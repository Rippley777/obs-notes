To set up Docker Compose on a virtual machine (VM) and allow it to be accessed remotely via a browser, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Set Up Your VM**

Ensure your VM is configured and accessible:

- Assign a static IP address or use the public IP provided by your cloud provider.
- Open required ports in the firewall (if applicable).
- Update the VM:
    
    `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
    

---

### 2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**

#### Install Docker:

`sudo apt install -y docker.io`

#### Enable Docker:

`sudo systemctl enable docker sudo systemctl start docker`

#### Install Docker Compose:

```
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    restart: always

```

---

### 3. **Create a Docker Compose Configuration**

Prepare a `docker-compose.yml` file for your application. Example for a simple web service (e.g., Nginx):

`version: "3.8" services:   web:     image: nginx     ports:       - "80:80"     volumes:       - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html     restart: always`

Create the required directory and HTML content:

`mkdir html echo "<h1>Hello from Docker Compose!</h1>" > html/index.html`

---

### 4. **Run Docker Compose**

Start the services with:

`sudo docker-compose up -d`

---

### 5. **Configure Firewall Rules**

#### Open Necessary Ports:

- Ensure port `80` (or any custom port) is open on your VM's firewall.
    
- For `UFW`:
    
    `sudo ufw allow 80 sudo ufw enable`
    
- For cloud provider-based VMs:
    
    - Add a rule to allow inbound traffic on port `80` in the cloud provider's control panel.

---

### 6. **Access the Application**

- Open a browser and navigate to your VM's public IP address or domain name:

    `http://<your-vm-ip>`
    
- You should see the "Hello from Docker Compose!" message.

---

### 7. **Secure Remote Access (Optional)**

For production environments:

- Use **HTTPS** with Let's Encrypt or another SSL certificate provider:
    - Add a reverse proxy (e.g., Traefik or Nginx).
    - Configure SSL/TLS.
- Limit remote access with security groups or IP whitelisting.

---

### 8. **Maintenance**

To manage the Docker Compose services:

- Restart services:

    `sudo docker-compose restart`
    
- View logs:

    `sudo docker-compose logs -f`
    
- Stop services:

    `sudo docker-compose down`
