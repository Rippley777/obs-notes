In the Docker Compose file example I provided earlier, the configuration includes a port mapping under the `nginx` service. Here’s the specific section that defines the port settings:


```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"

```

### Explanation of the Port Mapping Value

- `"80:80"`: This port mapping is defined as `"HOST:CONTAINER"`. It means that port 80 on the host (your Raspberry Pi or whichever machine is running Docker) is mapped to port 80 inside the `nginx` container. This setup is typical for a web server meant to serve content over HTTP, which traditionally uses port 80.

#### How This Affects Accessibility:

1. **Local Network Accessibility**: Any device on the same local network as your Docker host can access the Nginx service by navigating to the host machine's IP address, such as `http://192.168.1.XXX` (replace with your host's local IP), because the host's port 80 is directed to the container's port 80 where Nginx listens.
    
2. **Internet Accessibility**: If you configure your network router to forward port 80 to your Docker host machine's local IP address, then anyone on the internet can access your Nginx service by using your public IP address or a domain name if you have one configured (possibly through Dynamic DNS as discussed).
    

This configuration is essential for making the services running in your Docker containers accessible from outside the local machine or outside your local network, depending on your network setup and whether port forwarding is enabled and configured correctly on your router.


## Changing exposed port 

If you want to expose the service on port 1330 to the outside while keeping the internal container port as 80, you would modify the port mapping in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `nginx` service. Here's how you can adjust it:

### Original Setting

```yaml
ports:
  - "80:80"

```

### Modified Setting

```yaml
ports:
  - "1330:80"

```
In this modified setting, `"1330:80"` means:

- **1330** is the port on the host machine (your Raspberry Pi or any other machine running Docker). This is the port that you will use to access the service from outside the host.
- **80** is the port inside the container where your application (in this case, Nginx) is listening.

### Applying the Change

Once you've edited the `docker-compose.yml` file to reflect this change, you should run the following commands to apply the update:

1. **Stop the running containers** (if any):

```bash
docker-compose down

```

**Start the containers again** with the updated configuration:


```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
### Accessing the Service

After making this change and assuming all other configurations like network and firewall settings are correctly set up (including port forwarding on your router if accessing from the internet), you can access your Nginx service at:

- **Local Network**: `http://<host-ip>:1330` – Replace `<host-ip>` with the local IP address of your Docker host.
- **From the Internet**: `http://<public-ip-or-domain>:1330` – Replace `<public-ip-or-domain>` with your public IP address or configured domain name, assuming you have set up port forwarding for port 1330 to your Docker host's IP address.

This modification allows you to use a non-standard port for external access, which can be useful for avoiding conflicts with other services or for additional security by obscurity.
