When a port remains active even after killing the process that was using it, it could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Immediate Re-spawn**: The process might be configured to restart automatically when it's killed. This could be managed by a service manager like `systemd` or `supervisord`, or it could be part of a larger application managing its own restarts.
    
2. **Multiple Instances**: There might be multiple instances of the process, or another process might be taking over the port as soon as it's free.
    
3. **Socket in TIME_WAIT State**: Sometimes, even after a process is killed, the socket it was using can be stuck in the `TIME_WAIT` state, which prevents other processes from reusing the same port immediately.
    

Here’s how you can address these issues:

- **Check for automatic restarts**: If you're on a Unix-like system, check if there’s a service managing the process. You can use commands like `systemctl status [service-name]` or check the configuration files for process managers.
    
- **Find and kill all instances**: Make sure you've killed all instances of the process. Use commands like `lsof -i :[port-number]` or `netstat -tulpn | grep :[port-number]` to find all processes using the port and then kill them.
    
- **Handling TIME_WAIT State**: If the socket is in `TIME_WAIT`, you can adjust the system settings to reduce the time a socket remains in this state, although this might have implications for network stability. You can tweak settings like `tcp_fin_timeout`.
    
- **Forcefully reclaim the port**: If appropriate for your use case, you can set the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option in your application to allow it to bind to a port that is still in the `TIME_WAIT` state.

If Docker Compose is immediately respawning a service after you kill it, and thereby reclaiming the port, this behavior is typically by design. Docker Compose services are usually configured to restart automatically if they fail or are manually stopped, depending on the restart policy set in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Here are the typical restart policies you might see in a `docker-compose.yml` file:

1. **no**: Do not automatically restart the container.
2. **always**: Always restart the container if it stops.
3. **on-failure**: Restart the container only if it exits with a non-zero status.
4. **unless-stopped**: Restart the container unless it has been explicitly stopped.

### Steps to Modify Restart Behavior

If you want to change this behavior so that the service does not automatically restart, you can modify the restart policy in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Here’s how you might do it:

yaml

Copy code

`services:   your-service:     image: your-image     ports:       - "your-port:your-port"     restart: no  # Change this according to your needs`

After making changes to the `docker-compose.yml` file, you should re-launch your services for the changes to take effect:

bash

Copy code

`docker-compose down docker-compose up -d`

### Temporary Override

If you're troubleshooting or need to stop the service temporarily without changing the configuration file, you can use Docker Compose commands to stop the service:

bash

Copy code

`docker-compose stop your-service`

Or, if you want to stop and remove all containers managed by Docker Compose:

bash

Copy code

`docker-compose down`

These commands will stop the service and release the ports without changing the restart policy permanently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a port used by a Docker Compose service keeps getting reactivated immediately after you stop or kill the service, it's likely due to the service's restart policy, which automatically restarts the service upon exit. Here are some steps and options to control this behavior:

### Step 1: Identify the Restart Policy

First, check the restart policy set in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Look for a section similar to:

yaml

Copy code

`services:   example-service:     image: example-image     ports:       - "12345:12345"     restart: always  # This might be set to always, unless-stopped, or on-failure`

### Step 2: Modify or Remove the Restart Policy

To prevent the service from automatically restarting, you can change the `restart` policy to `no` or completely remove the line specifying the restart policy:

yaml

Copy code

`services:   example-service:     image: example-image     ports:       - "12345:12345"     restart: no  # Set to no to prevent automatic restart`

After updating the configuration, apply the changes by running:

bash

Copy code

`docker-compose down docker-compose up -d`

### Step 3: Stop Services Manually

If you need to manually stop the service temporarily without modifying the configuration file, you can use:

bash

Copy code

`docker-compose stop example-service`

This command stops the specific service. If the restart policy is not set to `always` or `unless-stopped`, the service should not restart automatically.

### Additional Considerations

If the service continues to restart even after these steps, ensure that there are no other orchestration tools or scripts that might be restarting the Docker containers automatically.

It might also be helpful to ensure that you have the latest configuration applied. Sometimes, configurations might not update correctly if Docker Compose is not restarted properly. Ensure all changes are loaded by using:

bash

Copy code

`docker-compose down docker-compose up -d`

This sequence ensures that all containers are recreated with the latest settings from your `docker-compose.yml` file.

If the problem persists, it would be helpful to check logs to understand why the containers are restarting:

bash

Copy code

`docker-compose logs example-service`

These logs can provide insights into why the service is being restarted or if there are errors leading to an unexpected restart condition.

The entry you're seeing in the context of network connections and ports, specifically this one: `TCP *:commplex-main (LISTEN)`, refers to a service or process listening on TCP port 1049, which is conventionally associated with the name `commplex-main`.

Here’s a breakdown of the parts of your query:

- **ControlCe**: This could be part of the name or description of the process using the port. This isn't a standard descriptor in Unix or Linux, so it might be specific to the software or service running.
- **1049**: This is the port number. Port 1049 is registered for use by `commplex-main`, according to the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) service name and transport protocol port number registry.
- **allyrippley**: This appears to be the username under which the process is running.
- **7u**: This indicates the file descriptor number. In Unix and Linux, everything is treated like a file, including network sockets. "7u" means this is the seventh file descriptor opened by the process and it is in use.
- **IPv4**: Indicates the protocol version being used, which is IPv4.
- **0x7591e948ca864d67**: This looks like a pointer or a unique identifier for the internal kernel structure representing the socket.
- **0t0**: This often represents the size of data not yet transmitted over the network or specific flags about the socket; in many outputs, this is zero, showing no pending data or specific condition.
- **TCP**: The type of protocol used for the communication.
- ***:commplex-main (LISTEN)**: The asterisk `*` indicates that the server is listening on all available IP addresses of the machine for connections on port `commplex-main`. The `LISTEN` state means the port is open and ready to accept connections.

The `commplex-main` service does not have a widely recognized standard use and might be specific to certain applications or services. If this is from a system you manage and you're not sure why this service is running, you might want to investigate the specific application using it, considering both its necessity and security implications.

If you're seeing this in a network or security audit and it's unexpected, it would be advisable to further investigate the nature of the service, check configuration files, or look at what software might have registered this service. This can help determine if it's legitimate or potentially malicious activity. If you have access to the machine, you can use commands like `ps` or `lsof` to find more information about the process using this port.
