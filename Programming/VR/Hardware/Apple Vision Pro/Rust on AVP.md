**you can run Rust on Apple Vision Pro**, but there are some limitations and workarounds to consider.

---

## **1. Does Rust Have Native Support for visionOS?**

Apple Vision Pro runs **visionOS**, which is based on **iOS/macOS**. Since Rust already works well with **iOS/macOS**, you can compile Rust code for **visionOS** by targeting the appropriate Apple architectures.

### **Supported Targets**

Rust officially supports:

- `aarch64-apple-ios` (iOS devices, similar to visionOS)
- `aarch64-apple-darwin` (macOS)
- `x86_64-apple-darwin` (Intel Macs)

Currently, visionOS is **not an officially supported Rust target**, but because it's close to iOS, you can use:

- `aarch64-apple-ios` (for iOS apps on visionOS)
- `aarch64-apple-darwin` (if running as a macOS app inside visionOS)

## **2. Running Rust in a Vision Pro App**

There are **two main ways** to use Rust in a Vision Pro app:

### **A. Use Rust as a Native Library in Swift (FFI Binding)**

Since visionOS apps are built using Swift + RealityKit, you can write **Rust logic** and expose it to **Swift via FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Compile Rust for Apple Silicon (visionOS)**

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-ios

```

**Use `cbindgen` to Generate a C Header for Swift**


```lua
[dependencies]
libc = "0.2"

```


```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn rust_function() -> i32 {
    42
}

```

Then call this Rust function from Swift:


```dart
import Foundation
@objc class RustBridge: NSObject {
    @objc func getRustValue() -> Int {
        return rust_function()
    }
}

```


1. **Integrate with Your visionOS App**
    - Add the Rust `.a` file to **Xcode**.
    - Use `import RustBridge` in Swift.

This lets you **run Rust code inside your Vision Pro app** while keeping the UI in Swift.

---

### **B. Run Rust as a CLI Binary on visionOS**

If you have **developer mode enabled** on Vision Pro, you can **compile and run Rust binaries** inside the system shell.

#### **Steps:**
**Cross-compile Rust for Apple Silicon**


```bash
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin

```

- **Transfer the Binary to Vision Pro**
    - Use **Xcode’s Developer Mode** to enable file transfers.
    - Deploy the compiled binary using **AirDrop** or **scp**.
- **Run the Rust App in visionOS' Terminal (if enabled)**

```bash
./my_rust_program

```

## **Can You Use Rust for a Full Vision Pro App?**

No, not **entirely**—you **still need Swift for UI** (RealityKit/SwiftUI). However, Rust can handle: ✅ **Game Logic**  
✅ **Networking** (via `tokio` or `async-std`)  
✅ **Data Processing**  
✅ **Interfacing with BLE Devices**
