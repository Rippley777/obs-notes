Alright, let's break this down **super simple** so it's easy to follow. No stress, just vibes. Weâ€™re making **"Babyâ€™s First AVP App"** (Audio/Video Processing), step by step, from **zero**. ðŸ’ª

## ðŸ”¥ Step 1: What Are We Even Doing?

We're making an app that takes **audio and/or video** and does something with it. It can be **playing**, **recording**, or **editing**. Since this is _baby's first app_, letâ€™s make it:

âœ… **Super simple**  
âœ… **Just worksâ„¢**  
âœ… **No overthinking**

## ðŸ›  Step 2: Pick Your Language

Do you want to do this in:

- [[**Python** (easier, fast results)]]
- [[**TypeScript (Node.js)** (web-friendly)]]
- [[**Rust** (powerful, but more work)]]
- [[**C or C++** (raw power, but ðŸ§ ðŸ”¥)]]

If you just wanna **see things work fast**, I say **Python** is the move.  
**But if you wanna make it a real app later, TypeScript (Node.js) is better**.

ðŸ‘¶ First-time AVP? Pick **Python**.  
ðŸ§  Future-proofing? Pick **TypeScript**.

Which one sounds good? ðŸ¤”
