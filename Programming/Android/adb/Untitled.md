The error message you're encountering indicates that the Android development environment can't find the Android SDK. This is a common setup issue, and it typically arises when either the SDK hasn't been installed or the path to it hasn't been set up correctly in your system's environment variables. Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

### 1. Verify SDK Installation

First, make sure that you have the Android SDK installed. If you are using Android Studio (which is the recommended way to manage the Android SDK), you can check and install the SDK as follows:

- Open Android Studio.
- Go to **Preferences** (on macOS) or **Settings** (on Windows/Linux).
- Navigate to **Appearance & Behavior** → **System Settings** → **Android SDK**.
- Check which SDK platforms and tools are installed. Typically, you'll want to have the latest Android SDK Platform, the Android SDK Build-Tools, and the Android SDK Command-line Tools installed.

If the SDK is not installed:

- Use the SDK Manager in Android Studio to download the Android SDK.

### 2. Set the ANDROID_HOME Environment Variable

Once the SDK is installed, you need to set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to the SDK location. The steps can vary depending on your operating system:

#### For macOS or Linux:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Find your shell's profile script. This could be `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc. You can edit it by typing `nano ~/.bash_profile` (or replace `.bash_profile` with your appropriate file).
3. Add the following lines to set `ANDROID_HOME` and update your `PATH` variable:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

```
    
    Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.
4. Save the file and exit the editor (`Ctrl+X`, confirm with `Y` to save).
5. Apply the changes by sourcing your profile script (e.g., `source ~/.bash_profile`).

#### For Windows:

6. Right-click on **This PC** or **My Computer** and choose **Properties**.
7. Go to **Advanced system settings** and then click the **Environment Variables** button.
8. Under System Variables, click **New** to create a new variable:
    - Variable name: `ANDROID_HOME`
    - Variable value: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Windows username.
9. Modify the `Path` system variable and add the following paths:
    - `%ANDROID_HOME%\emulator`
    - `%ANDROID_HOME%\tools`
    - `%ANDROID_HOME%\tools\bin`
    - `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools`
10. Click OK to close all dialogs.

### 3. Restart

After setting these environment variables, restart your terminal (for macOS or Linux) or your computer (for Windows) to ensure all settings are refreshed.

### 4. Verify Installation

Once everything is set up, you can verify the setup by running:


```bash
adb version

```

This command should return the version of the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), indicating that your path is correctly set.

This should help you resolve the SDK path issue and get your environment ready for Android development. If you encounter any further issues, it might be useful to also check the configurations in any IDEs or editors (like VS Code) that you're using to ensure they're pointing to the correct SDK paths.
