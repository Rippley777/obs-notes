### 2. **Nodemon**

- **Description:** Nodemon is a utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server. It's a tool for Node.js applications.
- **Use Case:** Perfect for development environments where you need to see the effect of your code changes in real-time without manually restarting the node server.

### 3. **Jest**
