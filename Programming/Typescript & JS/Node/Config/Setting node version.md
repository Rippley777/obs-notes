To specify the Node.js version for your project in the `package.json` file, you can use the `engines` field. This is particularly useful for ensuring compatibility across environments and for deploying to platforms like Heroku that read the Node version from `package.json`.

Here's how you can specify the Node version:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "14.x"
  }
}

```
In the example above, `14.x` means any version of Node.js that starts with `14`. You can be more specific or even set a range:

- **Exact Version:** `"node": "14.17.0"`
- **Range:** `"node": ">=14.0.0 <15.0.0"`
- **Greater than or equal to a version:** `"node": ">=14.0.0"`

Using the `engines` field does not enforce the Node version locally but serves as documentation and influences the environment on deployment platforms that support it. If you need to enforce a specific Node version during development, you might consider using tools like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) or `n` to manage and switch Node versions across projects.
