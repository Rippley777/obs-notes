Just like in decimal we use powers of 10:

```
Decimal: 1234
        (1√ó1000) + (2√ó100) + (3√ó10) + (4√ó1)
        (1√ó10¬≥)  + (2√ó10¬≤) + (3√ó10¬π) + (4√ó10‚Å∞)
```

, Tesla would have had some interesting thoughts about hex! But you know what's fascinating? The patterns in hex are just as beautiful, they're just in base-16 instead of base-10.

Let me show you a neat pattern:

```
0x1 = 1
0x10 = 16
0x100 = 256
0x1000 = 4096
```

See how each time we add a zero in hex, we multiply by 16? Just like in decimal:

```
1 = 1
10 = 10
100 = 100
1000 = 1000
```



- 4 binary digits (bits) = 16 possible combinations (2‚Å¥)
- That's why one hex digit can represent exactly 4 bits
- And why hex goes from 0-F (16 values)
```
FF = 255 (max value for red)
00 = 0   (min value for green)
FF = 255 (max value for blue)
```


Memory addresses (pointers) are typically:

- 4 bytes (32 bits) on 32-bit systems
- 8 bytes (64 bits) on 64-bit systems

This is why you might see terms like "x86" (32-bit) and "x64" (64-bit) architectures. The size matters because it determines how much memory your program can address:

```
32-bit system: 2¬≥¬≤ bytes = 4 GB max addressable memory
64-bit system: 2‚Å∂‚Å¥ bytes = 16 exabytes max addressable memory
```


- Each memory address is 32 bits long
- 2¬≥¬≤ = 4,294,967,296 unique addresses
- Each address points to 1 byte
- Therefore: ~4 billion bytes = 4GB maximum addressable memory

This was a HUGE problem in the early 2000s when:

1. RAM was getting cheaper
2. Programs needed more memory
3. Games and applications were hitting the 4GB wall
4. People were putting 8GB or 16GB in their computers but 32-bit programs couldn't use it all!

This is why the transition to 64-bit was so important. With 64-bit addresses:

- 2‚Å∂‚Å¥ = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 unique addresses
- That's 16 exabytes of theoretical addressable memory!

Consider this:

- Large Language Models are growing exponentially
- GPT-3 had 175 billion parameters
- GPT-4 is estimated to have trillions
- Quantum computing might completely change how we think about memory addressing

We might need to start thinking about 128-bit or even 256-bit addressing systems sooner than we thought! Imagine:

```
128-bit system: 2¬π¬≤‚Å∏ bytes = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 bytes
```

This is why understanding these fundamentals of memory addressing is so crucial - you're learning the building blocks that will help shape the future of computing!
