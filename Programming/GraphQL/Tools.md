There are several tools available that can help you work with GraphQL more effectively, both on the client and server sides. Here are some of the best tools for various aspects of GraphQL development:

1. **GraphQL Server Libraries:**
    
    - **Apollo Server:** A popular GraphQL server library that works with various Node.js frameworks, such as Express, Koa, and Hapi.
    - **GraphQL Yoga:** A fully-featured GraphQL server library based on Express and Apollo Server.
    - **Express-GraphQL:** A GraphQL server middleware for Express.js, which is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
2. **GraphQL Clients:**
    
    - **Apollo Client:** A comprehensive state management library for JavaScript applications that use GraphQL. It integrates well with popular frontend frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.
    - **Relay:** A JavaScript framework for building data-driven React applications with GraphQL. It provides a powerful data-fetching and caching mechanism.
3. **IDEs and Tools for Development:**
    
    - **GraphQL Playground:** An interactive IDE for writing and testing GraphQL queries and mutations. It offers features like auto-completion and real-time error highlighting.
    - **GraphiQL:** An in-browser IDE for exploring and testing GraphQL APIs. It's often integrated into GraphQL server libraries for easy access during development.
    - **Insomnia:** A REST and GraphQL client that allows you to create, organize, and execute queries and mutations, as well as inspect responses.
4. **Schema and API Documentation:**
    
    - **GraphQL Voyager:** A tool that allows you to visually explore your GraphQL schema and understand the relationships between different types.
    - **SpectaQL:** An automatic GraphQL API documentation generator that creates static HTML documentation from your schema.
5. **Testing and Mocking:**
    
    - **Apollo Server Testing:** A set of utilities for testing Apollo Server instances, including support for mocking and simulating queries and mutations.
    - **Mock Service Worker (MSW):** A library that allows you to mock network requests, including GraphQL requests, in browser and Node.js environments for testing purposes.
6. **Monitoring and Performance:**
    
    - **Apollo Studio:** A platform that provides insights into the performance and usage of your GraphQL API, including query tracing and error tracking.
    - **GraphQL Network:** A browser extension for Chrome that adds a "GraphQL" tab to the developer tools, allowing you to inspect GraphQL network requests and responses.

These tools can help you build, test, and optimize your GraphQL APIs more efficiently. The choice of tools depends on your specific requirements and the technologies you're using in your stack.
