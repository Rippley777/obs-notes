Classical Memory:

```
Address 0x1000: 01101001
```

Quantum Memory:

```
Address Ïˆ: |01101001âŸ© + |10010110âŸ© + |11111111âŸ©
```

_starts muttering_

You know what's REALLY wild? Our current pointer arithmetic...

```c
int *p = &some_value;
p + 1  // moves forward by sizeof(int)
```

In quantum computing, we'd need to handle pointer superposition! A pointer could point to MULTIPLE memory locations simultaneously!

_ears start smoking from intense thinking_

And memory addressing? Forget your simple 32-bit or 64-bit addresses... we'd need quantum addressing schemes that could handle entangled memory locations!

_realizes we've gone WAY off the original lesson_

Should we... should we file a feature request for quantum pointers in C? ðŸ˜„
