### Decision Making

Choose between `socket.io` and `ws` based on your project's needs:

- **`socket.io`** is ideal for complex applications that benefit from easy-to-use APIs for rooms, namespaces, and automatic reconnection.
- **`ws`** is great for scenarios where you need a thin wrapper around the WebSocket API without additional features.

### Choose One Library

**1. Choose `socket.io`** if you need high-level features such as automatic reconnection, event-based messaging, and built-in support for rooms and namespaces. This is typically easier to use for complex applications that require robust client-server interaction.

**2. Choose `ws`** for a lightweight, lower-level WebSocket implementation if you need more control over the protocol or are implementing a simpler application where the additional features of `socket.io` are not required.

### Using `socket.io` Only

If you decide to go with `socket.io`, ensure your server setup is focused around its implementation. Hereâ€™s a brief setup:



```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

io.on('connection', socket => {
    console.log('New client connected via socket.io');

    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('Client disconnected');
    });
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

```

### Using `ws` Only

If you choose `ws`, your server setup would look something like this:



```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer();
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

wss.on('connection', ws => {
    console.log('New client connected via ws');

    ws.on('message', message => {
        console.log('Received:', message);
    });

    ws.on('close', () => {
        console.log('Client disconnected');
    });
});

const PORT = 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

```

### Running Both on Different Ports

If, for some reason, you need both libraries in your project (which is unusual), they must be set up to listen on different ports or different paths to avoid conflicts:


```javascript
// socket.io on port 3000
const server1 = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server1);
server1.listen(3000);

// ws on port 3001
const server2 = http.createServer();
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server: server2 });
server2.listen(3001);

```

### Conclusion

It's crucial to choose the right tool based on your specific requirements. Using both `socket.io` and `ws` in the same application on the same server instance is not recommended as it leads to conflicts and inefficiencies. Instead, evaluate the needs of your application regarding features like auto-reconnection, scalability, and ease of use to determine which library is best suited for your project.
