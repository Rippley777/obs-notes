To connect two users and pass video data between them using WebRTC in a React application, you'll need to follow several steps to establish a peer-to-peer connection. This involves using WebRTC APIs to handle video streams and signaling to exchange necessary information for the connection setup.

### 1. Basic Setup

First, ensure your React app has access to media devices and can create a peer connection. Here’s a basic overview:

#### a. Get User Media

Use the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API to request access to the video (and optionally audio) devices.

#### b. Establish Peer Connections

Create a `RTCPeerConnection` for each user. This object manages the peer-to-peer connection and handles the negotiation of media and data transmission.

#### c. Signaling

Use a signaling mechanism (like WebSockets or any real-time communication system) to exchange offer, answer, and ICE candidates between peers.

### 2. Implementing the React Component

Here’s how you could implement a React component to handle video chat. This example includes only the client-side logic:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const configuration: RTCConfiguration = {
    iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }]
};

const VideoChat: React.FC = () => {
    const localVideoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
    const remoteVideoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
    const [localStream, setLocalStream] = useState<MediaStream | null>(null);
    const [peerConnection, setPeerConnection] = useState<RTCPeerConnection | null>(null);
    const [callActive, setCallActive] = useState(false);

    // Get local media stream
    useEffect(() => {
        navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
            .then(stream => {
                if (localVideoRef.current) {
                    localVideoRef.current.srcObject = stream;
                }
                setLocalStream(stream);
            })
            .catch(console.error);
    }, []);

    // Setup peer connection
    useEffect(() => {
        if (localStream && !peerConnection) {
            const pc = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration);
            localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => pc.addTrack(track, localStream));
            pc.ontrack = event => {
                if (event.streams[0] && remoteVideoRef.current) {
                    remoteVideoRef.current.srcObject = event.streams[0];
                }
            };
            pc.onicecandidate = event => {
                if (event.candidate) {
                    console.log('ICE candidate:', event.candidate);
                    // Here you would send the candidate to the remote peer
                }
            };
            setPeerConnection(pc);
        }
    }, [localStream]);

    // Create and send an answer to an offer
    const createAndSendAnswer = () => {
        peerConnection?.createAnswer().then(answer => {
            peerConnection?.setLocalDescription(answer);
            // Send the answer to the remote peer through the signaling server
        }).catch(console.error);
    };

    // Handle signaling data
    const handleSignalingData = (data: any) => {
        switch(data.type) {
            case 'offer':
                peerConnection?.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(data.offer));
                createAndSendAnswer();
                break;
            case 'answer':
                peerConnection?.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(data.answer));
                break;
            case 'candidate':
                peerConnection?.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(data.candidate));
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <video ref={localVideoRef} autoPlay playsInline muted />
            <video ref={remoteVideoRef} autoPlay playsInline />
            {callActive ? (
                <button onClick={() => {
                    peerConnection?.close();
                    setCallActive(false);
                }}>Hang Up</button>
            ) : (
                <button onClick={() => setCallActive(true)}>Start Call</button>
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

export default VideoChat;

```
### 3. Signaling

For the signaling mechanism, you will need to handle sending and receiving messages. Typically, this would be done with WebSockets or a similar real-time messaging service. The exact implementation can depend on the server infrastructure you are using (Node.js, Python, etc.), and you'd have to integrate it with your React client.

### 4. Starting and Handling Calls

You need to implement UI controls that allow users to start a call, accept a call, and hang up. This involves triggering the appropriate signaling processes when these UI elements are interacted with.

### 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases

Make sure to handle errors and edge cases, such as:

- Users denying camera/microphone access.
- Disconnections and retries for ICE gathering.
- Handling user hang-up and cleanup of media streams and peer connections.

This is a basic structure and will need to be expanded with signaling and error handling tailored to your specific application's requirements.



## Parent

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import VideoChat from './VideoChat'; // Assuming VideoChat is exported from VideoChat.tsx

const App: React.FC = () => {
    const [isVideoChatActive, setIsVideoChatActive] = useState(false);

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <header className="App-header">
                <h1>React Video Chat App</h1>
                {isVideoChatActive ? (
                    <button onClick={() => setIsVideoChatActive(false)}>
                        End Video Chat
                    </button>
                ) : (
                    <button onClick={() => setIsVideoChatActive(true)}>
                        Start Video Chat
                    </button>
                )}
            </header>
            {isVideoChatActive && <VideoChat />}
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;

```

To complete the system, you'll need to integrate WebSocket (or another real-time communication protocol) to handle the signaling required for WebRTC to establish peer connections.

Here’s how you can integrate WebSocket signaling into the `VideoChat` component. For simplicity, we'll assume you are using a WebSocket server available at `ws://localhost:8080`. You'll need to ensure that this server is set up to relay signaling messages between connected clients.

### 1. Setting Up WebSocket Client in the `VideoChat` Component

You will need to establish a WebSocket connection and handle the exchange of signaling messages (offers, answers, ICE candidates) between clients. Below is an enhanced version of the `VideoChat` component, now including WebSocket signaling:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const configuration: RTCConfiguration = {
    iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }]
};

const VideoChat: React.FC = () => {
    const localVideoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
    const remoteVideoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
    const [localStream, setLocalStream] = useState<MediaStream | null>(null);
    const [peerConnection, setPeerConnection] = useState<RTCPeerConnection | null>(null);
    const ws = useRef<WebSocket | null>(null);

    // Initialize WebSocket and handle incoming messages
    useEffect(() => {
        ws.current = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
        ws.current.onmessage = (message) => {
            const data = JSON.parse(message.data);
            switch(data.type) {
                case 'offer':
                    handleOffer(data.offer);
                    break;
                case 'answer':
                    handleAnswer(data.answer);
                    break;
                case 'candidate':
                    handleCandidate(data.candidate);
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
        };

        return () => {
            ws.current?.close();
        };
    }, []);

    // Handle WebRTC offers
    const handleOffer = async (offer: RTCSessionDescriptionInit) => {
        if (!peerConnection) initializePeerConnection();
        await peerConnection?.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer));
        const answer = await peerConnection?.createAnswer();
        await peerConnection?.setLocalDescription(answer!);
        ws.current?.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'answer', answer }));
    };

    // Handle WebRTC answers
    const handleAnswer = async (answer: RTCSessionDescriptionInit) => {
        await peerConnection?.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer));
    };

    // Handle ICE candidates
    const handleCandidate = async (candidate: RTCIceCandidateInit) => {
        await peerConnection?.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
    };

    // Initialize Peer Connection and stream handling
    const initializePeerConnection = () => {
        const pc = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration);
        localStream?.getTracks().forEach(track => {
            pc.addTrack(track, localStream);
        });
        pc.ontrack = event => {
            if (event.streams[0]) remoteVideoRef.current!.srcObject = event.streams[0];
        };
        pc.onicecandidate = event => {
            if (event.candidate) {
                ws.current?.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'candidate', candidate: event.candidate }));
            }
        };
        setPeerConnection(pc);
    };

    // Media stream handling
    useEffect(() => {
        navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
            .then(stream => {
                localVideoRef.current!.srcObject = stream;
                setLocalStream(stream);
            })
            .catch(console.error);
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <video ref={localVideoRef} autoPlay playsInline muted />
            <video ref={remoteVideoRef} autoPlay playsInline />
        </div>
    );
};

export default VideoChat;

```
### Key Additions and Changes:

- **WebSocket Initialization**: Added a WebSocket client within the `VideoChat` component to connect to your signaling server.
- **Message Handlers**: Functions like `handleOffer`, `handleAnswer`, and `handleCandidate` deal with different types of signaling messages received through the WebSocket.
- **Sending Messages**: ICE candidates and answers are sent to the signaling server as JSON strings.

This setup assumes you have a signaling server that relays these messages between clients as they join the same "room" or "session". You would need to implement this server logic separately to ensure that offers, answers, and candidates are forwarded appropriately between clients attempting to establish a peer connection.


## Creating an Offer
To create an offer in a WebRTC application, you use the `RTCPeerConnection` object’s `createOffer` method. This offer is then sent to the remote peer via your signaling mechanism, such as WebSockets, as part of establishing a peer-to-peer connection. Below, I will expand upon the previous `VideoChat` component example to include creating and sending an offer, and managing the signaling process.

### Expanded VideoChat Component with Offer Creation

Let's update the `VideoChat` component to include a function for initiating a call by creating an offer and handling the subsequent steps needed to establish the connection:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const configuration: RTCConfiguration = {
    iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }]
};

const VideoChat: React.FC = () => {
    const localVideoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
    const remoteVideoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
    const [localStream, setLocalStream] = useState<MediaStream | null>(null);
    const [peerConnection, setPeerConnection] = useState<RTCPeerConnection | null>(null);
    const ws = useRef<WebSocket | null>(null);

    // Initialize WebSocket and handle incoming messages
    useEffect(() => {
        ws.current = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
        ws.current.onmessage = (message) => {
            const data = JSON.parse(message.data);
            switch(data.type) {
                case 'offer':
                    handleOffer(data.offer);
                    break;
                case 'answer':
                    handleAnswer(data.answer);
                    break;
                case 'candidate':
                    handleCandidate(data.candidate);
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
        };

        return () => {
            ws.current?.close();
        };
    }, []);

    // Media stream handling
    useEffect(() => {
        navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
            .then(stream => {
                localVideoRef.current!.srcObject = stream;
                setLocalStream(stream);
            })
            .catch(console.error);
    }, []);

    // Initialize Peer Connection and stream handling
    const initializePeerConnection = () => {
        const pc = new RTCPeerConnection(configuration);
        localStream?.getTracks().forEach(track => {
            pc.addTrack(track, localStream);
        });
        pc.ontrack = event => {
            if (event.streams[0]) remoteVideoRef.current!.srcObject = event.streams[0];
        };
        pc.onicecandidate = event => {
            if (event.candidate) {
                ws.current?.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'candidate', candidate: event.candidate }));
            }
        };
        setPeerConnection(pc);
    };

    // Create and send an offer to initiate a call
    const createAndSendOffer = async () => {
        if (!peerConnection) initializePeerConnection();
        const offer = await peerConnection?.createOffer();
        await peerConnection?.setLocalDescription(offer!);
        ws.current?.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'offer', offer }));
    };

    // Handle WebRTC offers
    const handleOffer = async (offer: RTCSessionDescriptionInit) => {
        if (!peerConnection) initializePeerConnection();
        await peerConnection?.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer));
        const answer = await peerConnection?.createAnswer();
        await peerConnection?.setLocalDescription(answer!);
        ws.current?.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'answer', answer }));
    };

    // Handle WebRTC answers
    const handleAnswer = async (answer: RTCSessionDescriptionInit) => {
        await peerConnection?.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer));
    };

    // Handle ICE candidates
    const handleCandidate = async (candidate: RTCIceCandidateInit) => {
        await peerConnection?.addIceCandidate(new RTCIceCandidate(candidate));
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <video ref={localVideoRef} autoPlay playsInline muted />
            <video ref={remoteVideoRef} autoPlay playsInline />
            <button onClick={createAndSendOffer}>Start Call</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default VideoChat;

```
### Key Components:

1. **Creating an Offer**: The `createAndSendOffer` function is responsible for initializing a peer connection, creating an offer, setting it as the local description, and then sending this offer to the remote peer via your WebSocket server.
    
2. **Signal Handling**: The component handles various types of signaling data (`offer`, `answer`, `candidate`) received from the WebSocket server.
    
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Ensures that the signaling messages are sent and received correctly.
    

This setup requires a WebSocket server capable of appropriately routing messages between clients to facilitate the signaling process. Each client should be able to identify whom the messages should be sent to (typically managed by some form of session or room logic on


## Multiple Rooms
Implementing multiple rooms in a WebRTC application using an Express server involves managing the signaling for multiple peer connections grouped by distinct session identifiers or room IDs. You can use a WebSocket library like `socket.io`, which conveniently handles multiple rooms with built-in support for broadcasting and managing separate namespaces/rooms.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up multiple rooms for a WebRTC application using `socket.io` on an Express server:

### Step 1: Setup Express and Socket.io

First, ensure you have Express and Socket.io installed. If not, you can add them to your project:



```bash
npm install express socket.io
```


```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIo(server);

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

```
### Step 2: Implement WebSocket Signaling with Rooms

You can use `socket.io` to handle WebRTC signaling in different rooms. Each socket connection can join a specific room, and messages can be broadcasted to other sockets in the same room:

```javascript
io.on('connection', socket => {
    console.log('A user connected');

    // Joining a specific room
    socket.on('join', room => {
        socket.join(room);
        console.log(`User joined room: ${room}`);
    });

    // Handling WebRTC offer in a room
    socket.on('offer', (offer, room) => {
        socket.to(room).emit('offer', offer);
    });

    // Handling WebRTC answer in a room
    socket.on('answer', (answer, room) => {
        socket.to(room).emit('answer', answer);
    });

    // Handling ICE candidates in a room
    socket.on('candidate', (candidate, room) => {
        socket.to(room).emit('candidate', candidate);
    });

    // Handling user disconnection
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected');
    });
});

```


### Step 3: Client-Side Implementation

On the client side, ensure that each client joins the appropriate room and sends/receives messages to/from only that room. This can be done using the `socket.io` client library:




```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

// Join a room
socket.emit('join', 'room1');

// Send an offer to a room
socket.emit('offer', yourOffer, 'room1');

// Listen for offers
socket.on('offer', (offer) => {
    // Handle received offer
});

// Similar implementations for 'answer' and 'candidate'

```

### Step 4: Manage Rooms

You might want to add additional logic to manage the rooms:

- Limit the number of participants per room.
- Handle different types of rooms or settings based on application needs.
- Manage room lifecycle (e.g., deleting empty rooms, timed rooms).

### Step 5: Security and Error Handling

Ensure that your application handles errors and secures communications:

- Validate data coming from clients.
- Use `socket.io`'s built-in security features like CORS handling.
- Consider using HTTPS for your server to encrypt the WebSocket data.

This structure allows you to create a scalable and flexible application where multiple users can interact in separate rooms using WebRTC and WebSocket for signaling. The implementation can be adapted and extended based on specific requirements such as authentication, advanced room management, and integration with other services.



The number of video streams that can be simultaneously handled in a WebRTC application depends on various factors including the capabilities of the client devices, network conditions, server architecture, and the specific implementation details of the application. Here are the main factors that influence how many videos can be streamed at once:

### 1. **Client Hardware and Software**

- **Processing Power**: Handling video streams is computationally expensive. Encoding and decoding video requires significant CPU and, ideally, GPU resources. The more powerful the device, the more streams it can handle.
- **Memory**: Each video stream consumes a certain amount of RAM. Adequate memory is necessary to handle multiple streams smoothly.

### 2. **Network Conditions**

- **Bandwidth**: Video streaming consumes a lot of bandwidth. The available network bandwidth for each participant will limit the number of concurrent video streams they can send and receive. Lower bandwidth might require lowering the resolution or frame rate of the video streams.
- **Latency and Jitter**: High latency and jitter can affect the quality of the video streams and might limit the number of streams that can be effectively managed in real-time.

### 3. **Media Server (if used)**

- If your application routes video through a media server (SFU, MCU):
    - **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)**: This type of server forwards the incoming video stream to other participants without mixing them. It can handle more streams since it only reroutes the data.
    - **MCU (Multipoint Control Unit)**: This server mixes multiple video streams into one before sending it out to participants. It requires much more processing power and therefore might support fewer streams compared to an SFU.
- **Server Hardware**: The capabilities of the server (CPU, memory, network throughput) play a crucial role in how many streams it can handle, especially if using an MCU.

### 4. **WebRTC Configuration**

- **Stream Quality**: Adjusting the resolution, frame rate, and bitrate of the video streams can significantly impact how many streams can be actively managed. Lower settings can increase the number.
- **Simulcast**: This technique involves sending multiple versions of the same video stream at different qualities, allowing the server or receiving client to choose the appropriate one based on current network conditions.

### Practical Numbers

- **On a typical modern client device**, handling three to five high-quality video streams might be feasible under good network conditions. With optimizations and lower quality settings, more could be possible.
- **Servers**, depending on their specifications and whether they are using SFU or MCU architecture, can handle from dozens to hundreds of streams.
