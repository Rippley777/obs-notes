### **1. Google Cache or Wayback Machine**

- **Google Cache**: Search for the specific Reddit thread or comment using Google. Sometimes, Google's cached version of the page will still have the deleted comment.
    - Search query: `site:reddit.com "thread-title-or-keywords"`
    - Look for a small green arrow next to the URL in search results and click **Cached**.
- **Wayback Machine**: If the thread was archived by someone, you might find it on [archive.org](https://archive.org).

### **2. Third-Party Reddit Tools**

- **Removeddit** or **Reveddit**:
    - Visit [removeddit.com](https://removeddit.com) or [reveddit.com](https://reveddit.com) and enter the URL of the Reddit thread.
    - These tools track and display deleted comments and posts (provided they were indexed before deletion).

### **3. Browser History Tricks**

- If the comment was visible before the refresh, you might be able to retrieve some parts of it:
    - **Offline Cache Inspection**: Some browsers store cached page elements temporarily.
        - Open your browser's **Developer Tools** (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`).
        - Go to the **Network** tab and look for resources (like the Reddit page) that might still be partially cached.
    - **Saved Data**: Use the **"Inspect Element"** function on the page you refreshed, especially if you're unsure whether it actually deleted parts of the DOM.

### **4. Reddit's JSON**

- Check if the thread is still accessible via Reddit's JSON API:
    - Replace `reddit.com` with `reddit.com/.json` in the URL.
    - Example: `https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditName/comments/postid/.json`
    - Sometimes, deleted comments persist in the raw data for a short while.

### **5. Recovery Apps (Forensic Approach)**

- **Forensic Data Recovery**: Tools like **Photorec** or **Autopsy** (open-source) can sometimes retrieve cached files from your disk, but this depends on the size of your cache and whether it was overwritten.
