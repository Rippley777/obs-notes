### **1. Use Google Search Console**

- **Inspect URL:** In Google Search Console, use the **URL Inspection tool** to see how Googlebot views your webpage.
    - Enter the URL in the inspection tool.
    - Click "View Tested Page" → "More Info" to examine the **HTML, screenshots, and other resources** Googlebot retrieves.

---

### **2. Check Your Robots.txt File**

- Review the `robots.txt` file of your website to ensure it allows web crawlers to access critical parts of your site.
    - Example: `https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt`
- Ensure important sections aren’t disallowed unintentionally.

---

### **3. Check Meta Tags**

- View the `<head>` section of your website's HTML to ensure meta tags like `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` are not blocking crawlers from indexing your site.

---

### **4. Simulate Googlebot**

- Use tools to simulate how Googlebot or other crawlers view your page:
    - **Fetch as Google** in Search Console.
    - Browser extensions like [SEO Minion](https://www.seominion.com/) or User-Agent Switcher to view the site as a crawler.

---

### **5. Crawl Your Site with SEO Tools**

- Use SEO tools to crawl your website and identify issues:
    - **Screaming Frog SEO Spider**: Emulates web crawlers and highlights SEO issues.
    - **Sitebulb**: Provides visual crawl reports.
    - **Ahrefs Site Audit**: Analyzes crawling and indexing issues.

---

### **6. Use "View Source" and Rendered HTML**

- **Raw HTML:** Right-click on the page and select **View Page Source**. This shows the raw HTML sent to crawlers.
- **Rendered HTML:** Use browser dev tools (Ctrl+Shift+I → Elements) to inspect the DOM after JavaScript execution. Some crawlers render JavaScript before indexing.

---

### **7. Test JavaScript Rendering**

- Use tools like Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test or Rich Results Test to see if your JavaScript-based content is properly indexed.

---

### **8. Check HTTP Headers**

- Use tools like [Curl](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to inspect HTTP headers for:
    - Status codes (`200`, `301`, `404`, `500`, etc.).
    - Content-Type.
    - Canonical URLs (`<link rel="canonical">`).

---

### **9. Monitor Backlinks and Indexing**

- Use tools like **Ahrefs**, **SEMrush**, or **Moz** to monitor backlinks and see which pages are indexed and linked to.

---

### **10. Debug Sitemap**

- Validate your sitemap using Google Search Console or tools like XML Sitemap Validator. Ensure all critical pages are included and accessible.

---

### **11. Review Structured Data**

- Use Google's Rich Results Test to ensure structured data is properly implemented and visible to crawlers.

---

### **12. Check with Multiple Crawlers**

- Different crawlers may view your site differently. Test with:
    - Googlebot.
    - Bingbot.
    - Social media bots (e.g., Twitterbot, Facebook bot).
