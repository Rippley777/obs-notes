build momentum by doing something cool and tangible before diving deep into Rust for the **Apple Vision Pro (AVP)**. Since you just got your **AVP Developer Strap**, I’d say the best move is to experiment with something lightweight but meaningful to see how the platform feels and where you can push it.

### **Some Cool AVP Ideas to Start With**

Here are a few **high-impact but approachable** things you could do:

#### **1. Spatial UI Playground (SwiftUI + RealityKit)**

- Create a floating UI that exists **outside traditional app windows**.
- Experiment with **hand-tracking interactions**, moving elements with a pinch or gaze.
- See if you can make a **simple control panel** (maybe a file browser for your NAS?).

#### **2. XR HUD Overlay for Real-World Devices**

- Have an **AR HUD** that shows the status of your local servers, NAS, or even Hack The Box challenges.
- Use **visionOS’s live object tracking** to pin the HUD to an actual **physical device**.
- Could be useful for monitoring **latency, load, or active services** in real-time.

#### **3. Magnetic Field Visualizer (Tesla’s Dream)**

- This one aligns with your **magnetism research**:
    - Use **Metal shaders or RealityKit** to render a 3D visualization of **EM fields**.
    - Pull real-time data from an **external sensor** (ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or BladeRF?).
    - Display **frequency waves** or simulate how fields interact with objects.

#### **4. Mind-Machine Interface (EEG Integration)**

- Since you’re exploring **brainwave frequencies**, what if you built an **AVP biofeedback tool**?
- You could use **Neurosky, OpenBCI, or your ADS1299** to:
    - Display **brainwave changes in real time** as a floating AVP visual.
    - Trigger UI elements based on **meditative vs active states**.
    - Test **concentration-based UI control** (e.g., can you focus to select objects?).

#### **5. Spatial Code Editor / Console**

- Imagine coding in **a virtual space with floating terminals**.
- Try making an **interactive debugging tool**—where you could:
    - **Move objects around** to modify code live.
    - **Visualize data structures** in a way that’s not possible on a normal screen.

### **Next Steps**

1. **[[Set up visionOS SDK** and get comfortable with **SwiftUI + RealityKit]]** (even if you’re skeptical about Swift).
2. **Prototype a simple 3D UI**—even if it’s just floating buttons.
3. If you want **EEG or RF data integration**, we can look at how to get that data into visionOS.
