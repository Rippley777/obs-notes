Yes, you can use SQLite with Go! The Go programming language has several libraries available for integrating SQLite, making it a good choice for projects that require a lightweight, embedded database. Here’s how you can get started using SQLite in your Go applications:

### 1. **Choose a SQLite Library**

The most popular library for using SQLite in Go is `go-sqlite3`, which is a Go driver for SQLite that provides a database/sql compatible interface. This library requires cgo to interface with the SQLite C library, but it's widely used and supports many of SQLite's features.

### 2. **Install the go-sqlite3 Package**

To use `go-sqlite3`, you need to install it first. You can do this using Go's package management tool. Here's the command to install it:


```bash
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3

```

### 3. **Use SQLite in Your Go Code**

Here’s a simple example of how to use SQLite with Go. This example will create a database, set up a table, and insert some data into it:

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"
    "log"

    _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
)

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", "./test.db")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer db.Close()

    // Create a table
    sqlStmt := `
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS userinfo (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        username TEXT,
        departname TEXT,
        created DATE
    );
    `
    _, err = db.Exec(sqlStmt)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("%q: %s\n", err, sqlStmt)
        return
    }

    // Insert data
    _, err = db.Exec("INSERT INTO userinfo(username, departname, created) VALUES(?, ?, ?)", "john", "Engineering", "2022-04-12")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Query the data
    rows, err := db.Query("SELECT id, username, departname, created FROM userinfo")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer rows.Close()

    for rows.Next() {
        var id int
        var username, departname, created string
        err = rows.Scan(&id, &username, &departname, &created)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
        fmt.Println(id, username, departname, created)
    }
    err = rows.Err()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

### 4. **Build and Run Your Application**

Make sure your environment is set up for CGO, as `go-sqlite3` uses CGO to bind with SQLite’s C implementation. You'll need GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system to use CGO.

After setting up, you can compile and run your Go application as usual. The example above will create an SQLite file named `test.db` in the same directory, insert a row, and then read it back.

### 5. **Handle Dependencies for Production**

When moving to production, make sure to handle any platform-specific dependencies, particularly around the CGO setup and SQLite version compatibility. Docker can be useful here to ensure a consistent deployment environment.

Using SQLite with Go, especially with `go-sqlite3`, provides a robust solution for applications requiring a simple yet powerful local storage system. This setup is great for small to medium applications, embedded systems, or even for prototyping and testing new ideas.
