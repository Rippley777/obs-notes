### Step 1: Install flask-cors

First, you need to install the `flask-cors` package. You can add it to your project using pip:

`pip install flask-cors`

### Step 2: Import and Use CORS in Your Flask Application

You can configure CORS for your entire application or just for specific routes. Here’s how to do it:

#### To enable CORS for all routes:

`from flask import Flask from flask_cors import CORS  app = Flask(__name__) CORS(app)  @app.route("/") def hello_world():     return "Hello, World!"  if __name__ == "__main__":     app.run()`

#### To enable CORS for a single route:

`from flask import Flask from flask_cors import cross_origin  app = Flask(__name__)  @app.route("/") @cross_origin()  # This decorator allows CORS for this route def hello_world():     return "Hello, World!"  if __name__ == "__main__":     app.run()`

### Step 3: Configure CORS Options

The `flask-cors` extension is highly customizable. You can specify which domains are allowed to access your resources, which methods are allowed, and whether cookies can be included with cross-origin requests, among other settings.

Here’s an example of a more detailed CORS configuration:

`from flask import Flask from flask_cors import CORS  app = Flask(__name__)  cors = CORS(app, resources={     r"/api/*": {         "origins": ["http://example.com", "https://sub.example.com"],         "methods": ["GET", "POST", "DELETE", "PUT"],         "allow_headers": ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]     } })  @app.route("/api/data") def data():     return {"data": "This is some data"}  if __name__ == "__main__":     app.run()`

### Step 4: Test Your Configuration

After setting up CORS, test your configuration to ensure that your application can accept requests from the allowed origins. You can do this by making requests from different client-side applications to see if the CORS headers are being handled correctly.

### Tips:

- Be cautious with the origins you allow; specifying `*` (which means "any origin") can expose your API to potentially unwanted cross-origin requests.
- Always test CORS configurations in a staging environment before deploying them to production to avoid unexpected behaviors.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve most CORS issues in your Flask applications.
