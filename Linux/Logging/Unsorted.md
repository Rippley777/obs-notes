## 1. Viewing UFW Logs

UFW logs provide information about firewall activity, such as blocked or allowed connections.

### Enable UFW Logging

If logging is not enabled, turn it on:
```bash
sudo ufw logging on
```

Logging levels available:
- `low`: Minimal information.
- `medium`: Recommended for most users (default).
- `high`: Most verbose.

Set the desired logging level:
```bash
sudo ufw logging medium
```

### View UFW Logs in Real-Time

Logs are stored in `/var/log/ufw.log`. To view them live:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/ufw.log
```

### View Historical UFW Logs

Use `less` or `grep` to examine past logs:
```bash
sudo less /var/log/ufw.log
```

Filter logs for specific entries (e.g., `BLOCK`):
```bash
grep BLOCK /var/log/ufw.log
```

## 2. Viewing WireGuard Logs

WireGuard logs provide insights into VPN activity, such as handshake failures and connection states.

### Logs with `journalctl`

If WireGuard is managed by `wg-quick` and `systemd`, view logs with:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u wg-quick@<wg-interface> -f
```
Replace `<wg-interface>` with your interface name (e.g., `wg0`).

### Debugging Connection Issues

Increase verbosity for detailed logs:
1. Add the following to the `[Interface]` section of your WireGuard configuration file:
   ```
   [Interface]
   ...
   PostUp = wg show
   PostDown = wg show
   ````
2. Restart the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart wg-quick@<wg-interface>
   ```

View logs again:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u wg-quick@<wg-interface>
```

## 3. Viewing Traefik Logs

Traefik logs include details about routing, certificate issues, and errors.

### Logs in Systemd

If Traefik runs as a systemd service:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u traefik -f
```

### Logs in Docker

If Traefik runs in a Docker container, view logs with:
```bash
docker logs -f <traefik-container-name>
```

Find the container name:
```bash
docker ps
```

### Customize Traefik Logging

To configure log levels, edit the Traefik configuration file (YAML or TOML):

#### YAML Example:
```yaml
log:
  level: DEBUG
  filePath: "/var/log/traefik.log"
```

#### TOML Example:
```toml
[log]
  level = "DEBUG"
  filePath = "/var/log/traefik.log"
```

Restart Traefik to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart traefik
```

## General Tips for Viewing Logs

### Follow Logs in Real-Time

Use `-f` to follow logs as they are written:
```bash
tail -f /path/to/log/file
```

### Search Within Logs

Use `grep` to filter log entries:
```bash
grep "keyword" /path/to/log/file
```

### Rotate and Manage Logs

Ensure logs donâ€™t grow too large by configuring log rotation:
1. Check `/etc/logrotate.d/` for relevant log files.
2. Customize rotation settings (e.g., size, frequency).

This guide ensures you can monitor and troubleshoot UFW, WireGuard, and Traefik effectively. Adjust verbosity and configurations based on your specific needs.
