Under Linux, permissions are assigned to [users](Users.md) and groups. Each user can be a member of different groups, and membership in these groups gives the [user](Users.md) specific, additional permissions. Each file and directory belongs to a specific user and a specific group. So the permissions for users and groups that defined a file are also defined for the respective owners. When we create new files or directories, they belong to the group we belong to and us.

When a user wants to access the contents of a Linux directory, they must first traverse the directory, which means navigating to that directory, requiring the user to have `execute` permissions on the directory. Without this permission, the user cannot access the directory's contents and will instead be presented with a “`Permission Denied`" error message.

Permission Management

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -l

drw-rw-r-- 3 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3   4096 Jan 12 12:30 scripts


cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -al mydirectory/

ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/script.sh': Permission denied
ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/..': Permission denied
ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/subdirectory': Permission denied
ls: cannot access 'mydirectory/.': Permission denied
total 0
d????????? ? ? ? ?            ? .
d????????? ? ? ? ?            ? ..
-????????? ? ? ? ?            ? script.sh
d????????? ? ? ? ?            ? subdirectory
```

It is important to note that `execute` permissions are necessary to traverse a directory, no matter the user's level of access. Also, `execute` permissions on a directory do not allow a user to execute or modify any files or contents within the directory, only to traverse and access the content of the directory.

To execute files within the directory, a user needs `execute` permissions on the corresponding file. To modify the contents of a directory (create, delete, or rename files and subdirectories), the user needs `write` permissions on the directory.

The whole permission system on Linux systems is based on the octal number system, and basically, there are three different types of permissions a file or directory can be assigned:

- (`r`) - Read
- (`w`) - Write
- (`x`) - Execute

The permissions can be set for the `owner`, `group`, and `others` like presented in the next example with their corresponding permissions.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb[/htb]$ ls -l /etc/passwd

- rwx rw- r--   1 root root 1641 May  4 23:42 /etc/passwd
