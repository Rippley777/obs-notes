Besides assigning direct user and group permissions, we can also configure special permissions for files by setting the `Set User ID` (`SUID`) and `Set Group ID` (`SGID`) bits. These `SUID`/`SGID` bits allow, for example, users to run programs with the rights of another user. Administrators often use this to give their users special rights for certain applications or files. The letter "`s`" is used instead of an "`x`". When executing such a program, the SUID/SGID of the file owner is used.

It is often the case that administrators are not familiar with the applications but still assign the SUID/SGID bits, which leads to a high-security risk. Such programs may contain functions that allow the execution of a shell from the pager, such as the application "`journalctl`."

If the administrator sets the SUID bit to "`journalctl`," any user with access to this application could execute a shell as `root`. More information about this and other such applications can be found at [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/journalctl/).
