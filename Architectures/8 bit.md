Ah, the elegant simplicity of 8-bit systems! These are still alive and well in:

- Microcontrollers (like Arduino)
- Classic gaming consoles (NES, Game Boy)
- Simple embedded devices
- Industrial control systems

Some key specs to whet your appetite:

- NES: MOS 6502 processor (8-bit)
- Game Boy: Sharp LR35902 (modified Z80, 8-bit)

If you're interested in this path, you might want to start with:

1. Learning 6502 or Z80 assembly
2. Understanding memory mapping
3. Studying how sprites and tile-based graphics work
4. Exploring hardware interrupts
