- **Install GPG keys**: RVM uses GPG keys for verification. You can install them using the following command:
    `gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB`
    
    If you encounter issues with the key server, you can try an alternative like `hkp://ipv4.pool.sks-keyservers.net`.
    
- **Install RVM**: Use the following command to install the latest stable version of RVM:
    `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
    
    This command downloads a script and executes it. The script installs RVM in your home directory and adds initialization code to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).
    
- **Load RVM into your shell session**: To start using RVM, you need to load it into your shell session. You can do this by running:
    `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm`
    
    It's recommended to close and reopen your terminal to ensure that RVM is fully integrated.
    
- **Verify the installation**: After installation, verify that RVM is installed correctly by running:
    `rvm -v`
    
    This command should display the version of RVM installed on your system.
    
- **Install Ruby**: With RVM installed, you can now install Ruby versions. For example, to install Ruby 3.0.0, run:
    `rvm install 3.0.0`
    
    After installation, you can switch to the newly installed Ruby version using:
    `rvm use 3.0.0`
    
- **Set a default Ruby version** (optional): You can set a default Ruby version for new shell sessions with:
    `rvm --default use 3.0.0`
