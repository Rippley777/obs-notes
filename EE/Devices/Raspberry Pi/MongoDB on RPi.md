Setting up MongoDB on a Raspberry Pi can be challenging due to the Pi's limited resources, but it's definitely doable. Here are some steps and tips to help you get MongoDB running on your Raspberry Pi, assuming you're using a recent model (Raspberry Pi 3 or later) and a compatible operating system like Raspberry Pi OS:

### Step 1: Update Your System

First, make sure your system is up to date. This will help avoid compatibility issues.



```bash
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install MongoDB

As of my last update, MongoDB doesn't provide official ARM builds for the Raspberry Pi. However, you can install MongoDB from a third-party repository or compile it from source. Here's how you can install it from a third-party repository:

1. **Add the MongoDB repository** (this example uses a community-maintained repo):



```bash
sudo apt install -y dirmngr
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10
echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/debian stretch/mongodb-org/4.0 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list 

```

**Update your package list**:


```bash
sudo apt update

```

MongoDB



```bash
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org

```
### Step 3: Configure MongoDB to Start Automatically

Enable MongoDB to start automatically upon system reboot:


```bash
sudo systemctl enable mongod

```


### Step 4: Start MongoDB

You can start the MongoDB service using the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

If you encounter issues with starting the service, you can check the status or view logs for more information:


```bash
sudo systemctl status mongod
sudo journalctl -u mongod
```
### Step 5: Verify Installation

Verify that MongoDB is running by connecting to the database server:


```bash
mongo
```

### Optimization Tips

Given the limited resources of the Raspberry Pi, consider the following optimizations:

- **Storage**: Use a high-quality SD card or an external SSD for better I/O performance.
- **Memory Usage**: Configure MongoDB's memory usage to suit your available resources. You can limit MongoDBâ€™s memory usage via the `storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.cacheSizeGB` setting in the MongoDB config file (`/etc/mongod.conf`).
- **Swap Space**: Increasing the swap space may help if your Raspberry Pi runs out of RAM.

### Alternatives

If MongoDB is too resource-intensive, consider lighter alternatives like SQLite, or even a NoSQL option like Redis or PouchDB, which may be more suitable for the Raspberry Pi's hardware.
