Setting up a WebRTC backend with a SQLite database on a Raspberry Pi using Docker Compose involves several steps. Below, I'll outline a basic setup which includes:

1. A WebRTC backend application container.
2. A SQLite database as a file within the project directory (since SQLite runs directly in the application process, you won't need a separate container for it).

### Step 1: Prepare the Raspberry Pi

Ensure your Raspberry Pi is set up with Docker and Docker Compose. You can install these if they are not already installed by following these commands:


```bash
# Install Docker
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Add permission to Pi user to run Docker commands
sudo usermod -aG docker pi

# Test Docker installation
docker run hello-world

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev
sudo pip3 install docker-compose

```

### Step 2: Create Your Project Directory

Create a directory on your Raspberry Pi for your project


```bash
mkdir webrtc-project
cd webrtc-project

```

### Step 3: WebRTC Backend

You'll need a WebRTC server. For simplicity, let's assume you're using Node.js with `wrtc` or a similar package. Create a basic application or use an existing one. You will also need a `Dockerfile` in the project directory:

**Dockerfile**

```dockerfile
# Using the official Node.js 12 image for compatibility with Raspberry Pi
FROM node:12-buster-slim

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the app
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

```

**Note**: Make sure your Node.js application is compatible with the architecture of the Raspberry Pi.

### Step 4: Integrate SQLite

Since SQLite runs within the same process as your application, ensure that your Node.js application is correctly set up to use SQLite. For instance, using `sqlite3` npm package.

**Install sqlite3**


```bash
npm install sqlite3

```
### Step 5: Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines how to build and run your WebRTC application

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  webrtc:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "./data:/usr/src/app/data"  # Persist SQLite data
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production

```

### Explanation

- **build**: Points to the Dockerfile in the current directory.
- **ports**: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container, making the WebRTC server accessible outside the Raspberry Pi.
- **volumes**: Mounts a local folder to store the SQLite database files persistently. This directory will be used by your application to read/write the SQLite database.

### Step 6: Running Your Application

With everything set up, you can start your WebRTC server by running


```bash
docker-compose up -d

```

This command will build the Docker image if it's not built yet and start the container. Your WebRTC backend should now be running on the Raspberry Pi and accessible via port 8080.

This setup provides a simple, lightweight deployment suitable for development and small-scale production environments, especially useful in constrained environments like a Raspberry Pi.


## Choosing a backend

The performance of a backend for a WebRTC application with SQLite can vary depending on several factors, including the specific requirements of the application, the expected load, and the network conditions. However, when selecting a backend, it's crucial to choose one that can handle real-time data efficiently and manage the database operations smoothly.

### Recommended Backend Technologies for WebRTC with SQLite:

#### 1. **Node.js**

- **Why?** Node.js is known for its non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling I/O-heavy operations like real-time communication. Libraries like `ws` for WebSockets and `wrtc` for WebRTC can be integrated directly into a Node.js application.
- **Performance**: It handles concurrent connections well, thanks to its asynchronous nature, which is beneficial for real-time data transmission in WebRTC.
- **Database Integration**: Node.js works well with SQLite through libraries like `sqlite3`, which is efficient for handling low to moderate amounts of data with moderate read/write requirements.

#### 2. **Go (Golang)**

- **Why?** Go provides excellent support for concurrency with goroutines, which are lightweight and managed by the Go runtime. This makes Go a strong candidate for backend services that require high-performance and efficient parallel task processing.
- **Performance**: Go's built-in concurrency and fast execution make it ideal for real-time applications like those using WebRTC. It can handle a large number of connections and high throughput with less overhead than some other languages.
- **Database Integration**: Go supports SQLite through third-party libraries like `go-sqlite3`. The language's performance characteristics ensure that database interactions are handled efficiently even under load.

#### 3. **Rust**

- **Why?** Rust offers memory safety without garbage collection, and its async capabilities are excellent for building high-performance network services. Its type system and borrowing concepts can prevent bugs at compile-time, enhancing reliability and performance.
- **Performance**: Rust's asynchronous runtime, such as Tokio, provides a scalable platform for IO-bound and CPU-bound operations typical in WebRTC applications.
- **Database Integration**: Rust can interface with SQLite databases via crates like `rusqlite` or `diesel` with SQLite feature, providing both synchronous and asynchronous database operations.

### Considerations for SQLite

While SQLite is a fantastic lightweight database, its use in a high-concurrency or high-write environment can be limiting due to its write locking mechanism, where only one write operation can proceed at a time. For applications expected to scale significantly, you might consider using a more robust database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL. However, for many small to medium applications, SQLite's simplicity and reliability outweigh its concurrency limitations.

### Conclusion

The choice of backend technology depends on specific project requirements, expertise available, and the operational environment. Node.js is commonly chosen for WebRTC applications due to its robust ecosystem and real-time capabilities. However, if performance under high concurrency is a priority, Go or Rust could provide better efficiency and scalability.
