Exposing a Raspberry Pi's port to public access involves several steps, primarily focused on configuring your network and Raspberry Pi for external connectivity. This setup is essential for services like web servers, game servers, or any application you want to be accessible from outside your local network. Here are the steps you’ll need to follow:

### Step 1: Set a Static IP Address for Your Raspberry Pi

Before exposing a port, it's helpful to assign a static IP address to your Raspberry Pi to ensure it doesn’t change on your network.

#### For Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS:

1. **Edit the dhcpcd configuration file**:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```

**Add the following lines**, adjusting them for your network configuration:



```plaintext
interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8

```

- eplace `192.168.1.100` with the IP you want for your Pi, and `192.168.1.1` with your router’s IP address.
    
- **Restart the dhcpcd service**:

```bash
sudo service dhcpcd restart

```

### Step 2: Configure Port Forwarding on Your Router

Port forwarding allows external devices to access services on your Raspberry Pi through your router.

1. **Access your router’s web interface** by entering its IP address in a web browser.
2. **Locate the port forwarding settings**. This might be under sections like ‘Port Forwarding’, ‘Applications’, ‘Gaming’, ‘Virtual Servers’, or similar.
3. **Create a new port forwarding rule**:
    - **Service Name**: Give your service a name (e.g., “Web Server”).
    - **Port Range**: Enter the port number you want to expose. If your app runs on port 80, enter 80.
    - **Local IP**: Enter your Raspberry Pi’s static IP address.
    - **Local Port**: Set this to the same as the port range if unsure.
    - **Protocol**: Choose TCP, UDP, or Both, depending on what your service needs.
4. **Save or apply the changes**.

### Step 3: Obtain or Configure a Dynamic DNS (Optional)

If your home internet has a dynamic public IP address, it's useful to set up Dynamic DNS (DDNS). This gives you a domain name that automatically updates to point to your Raspberry Pi's current public IP address.

1. **Choose a DDNS provider** such as No-IP or DynDNS.
2. **Set up an account and choose a hostname**.
3. **Configure DDNS settings in your router**, if it supports it, or set up a DDNS client on your Raspberry Pi.

### Step 4: Test Your Configuration

To test if your port is open and accessible:

4. **Use an online port check tool** like canyouseeme.org.
5. **Enter your public IP and the port number** you forwarded.
6. **Check for success** indicating the port is open.

### Step 5: Consider Security Implications

Exposing ports to the internet can make your Raspberry Pi a target for attacks. Consider the following security measures:

- **Update your Raspberry Pi** regularly (`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`).
- **Install a firewall** and configure it to only allow necessary traffic.
- **Use secure protocols** like HTTPS or SSH instead of HTTP or Telnet.
- **Regularly check logs** for unauthorized access attempts.
