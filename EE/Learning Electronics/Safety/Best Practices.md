Here are some **non-negotiable safety practices**:

### ⚠️ **Wireless Energy & Coil Experiments**

1. **Capacitor Safety:**
    
    - Capacitors, especially large ones, can retain lethal charges even when disconnected.
    - **Discharge with a resistor**, not a screwdriver. (You don’t want the _pop_ or molten metal flying.)
2. **RF Safety:**
    
    - **RF burns** happen when high-frequency currents flow on the skin's surface.
    - Wear **insulated gloves** and keep bare skin away from antennas and coils during operation.
    - Don't experiment with **brainwave frequencies** (EEG) at high power—just stick to monitoring for now.
3. **Grounding is Sacred:**
    
    - Always ground your primary coil, tools, and chassis.
    - A dedicated grounding rod is best—your house ground can introduce noise or cause issues.

### 🔋 **Power Supply Safety**

4. **Low Voltage ≠ No Danger:**
    
    - Wireless energy can create unpredictable field patterns.
    - Start with **low power** (your adjustable power supply will help here) and slowly increase only when you're confident.
5. **Fuse Everything:**
    
    - Place fuses between your battery and the circuit.
    - If something shorts, you'll thank your past self.
6. **Battery Safety:**
    
    - Don’t use damaged Li-ion cells—they can vent toxic gas or explode.
    - Always charge batteries with a proper charger, and never leave them unattended.

### ⚙️ **Tool Safety**

1. **Insulated Tools Only:**
    - For high-voltage sections, use insulated screwdrivers and pliers.
2. **Test Before Touching:**
    - Even if you “know” it’s off, use your multimeter to check for voltage.

### 🧠 **Mental Model for Safety**

- Assume **every component is energized** until proven otherwise.
- Assume **every unfamiliar component could cause harm** until identified.

### 🧲 **Magnetic Fields & Brainwave Work**

- Keep **metal tools, watches, and phones** away from energized coils—fields can fry electronics.
- **Brainwave experiments** should stay in **passive monitoring mode** only—no induced fields until you’ve got a solid grasp of safe exposure limits.

### 🚨 **Emergency Plan**

- **Fire Extinguisher:** Have a **Class C** fire extinguisher nearby.
- **Kill Switch:** Your **foot kill-switch** idea is brilliant—make sure it’s easily accessible.
- **Ventilation:** Tesla coils can generate ozone and other byproducts. Open a window or use a fan.
