### **Whatâ€™s an LC Circuit?**

- Itâ€™s made of **L (Inductor) and C (Capacitor)**.
- The capacitor **stores energy**, and the inductor **swaps it between electrical and magnetic energy** in a cycle.
- This creates **resonance**â€”a specific frequency where energy transfers **most efficiently**.

### **Why Resonance Matters for Wireless Energy**

- If you hit the **right frequency**, energy can transfer **wirelessly** with minimal loss.
- Teslaâ€™s work was all about finding the **perfect resonance** for power transmission.

ðŸ“Œ **Immediate Next Step:** Build a **basic LC circuit** with a capacitor and an inductor, then measure its resonance with an oscilloscope (or simulate it).
