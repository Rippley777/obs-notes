For AC circuits, **resistance isnâ€™t enough**â€”you also have to deal with:

#### **âš¡ Reactance (X)**

- **Capacitive Reactance (Xc)** â†’ Opposition to AC from capacitors.
- **Inductive Reactance (Xl)** â†’ Opposition to AC from inductors.

ðŸ”¹ **Why does this matter?**

- At **high frequencies, capacitors block DC but pass AC**.
- **Inductors do the opposite**â€”they block AC at high frequencies.

This is how **filters, oscillators, and radio circuits work!**
