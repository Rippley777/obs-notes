Every component falls into one of these categories:

#### **âš¡ Passive Components (Do NOT amplify power)**

- **Resistors** (limit current).
- **Capacitors** (store energy).
- **Inductors** (store energy in a magnetic field).

#### **âš¡ Active Components (Can amplify power)**

- **Transistors (BJTs, MOSFETs)** â†’ Switch & amplify signals.
- **Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps)** â†’ Amplify voltage.
- **Diodes** â†’ Allow current to flow in **one direction** only.

ðŸ”¹ **Why is this important?**  
Active components are the **heart of amplifiers, processors, and switching circuits**.
