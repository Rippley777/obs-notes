#### **âš¡ DC (Direct Current)**

- **Flows in one direction.**
- Used in **batteries, microcontrollers, computers**.

#### **âš¡ AC (Alternating Current)**

- **Changes direction** many times per second (e.g., **60Hz in the U.S.**).
- Used in **power grids, transformers, motors**.
- Can be stepped up/down efficiently with transformers.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Concept:**  
AC circuits have **frequency (Hz)** and components react differently than in DC (e.g., **capacitors block DC but pass AC**).




## Different components will react differently

Example:

|Component|DC Behavior|AC Behavior|
|---|---|---|
|**Capacitor**|**Blocks DC** (acts like an open circuit once charged)|**Passes AC** (constantly charging & discharging)|
|**Inductor**|**Passes DC** (acts like a wire after initial resistance)|**Blocks AC** (higher frequency = more resistance)|

ðŸ”¹ **Real-world Examples**

- **Capacitors in power supplies** â†’ Filter out AC ripple, allowing smooth DC.
- **Inductors in RF circuits** â†’ Block high-frequency noise in power lines.
- **AC/DC converters** â†’ Use capacitors & inductors together to shape signals.

This principle is **foundational** for filters, RF circuits, and power electronics.
