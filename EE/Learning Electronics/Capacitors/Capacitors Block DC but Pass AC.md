Think of a capacitor as **two metal plates separated by an insulator (dielectric)**.

1. **In a DC Circuit (Direct Current)**:
    
    - When you first connect DC voltage, the capacitor **charges up** like a tiny battery.
    - Once it's **fully charged**, **no more current flows** because the plates are separated by an insulator.
    - The capacitor **acts like an open circuit**, meaning **DC current is blocked**.
2. **In an AC Circuit (Alternating Current)**:
    
    - AC voltage **constantly changes direction** (switches between positive & negative).
    - The capacitor **never fully charges** because the voltage is always changing.
    - This means **current keeps flowing**, making it look like the capacitor is passing AC.

ðŸ”¹ **TL;DR:** A **fully charged capacitor in DC acts like an open switch**, but in **AC, it keeps charging/discharging, allowing current to "flow."**
