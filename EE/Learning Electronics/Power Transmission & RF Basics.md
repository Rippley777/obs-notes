## **Power Transmission & RF Basics**

- **[[AC vs DC]]**: AC (Alternating Current) constantly changes direction (what comes from the grid), while DC (Direct Current) flows in one direction (like batteries).
- **Impedance Matching**: Ensures maximum power transfer between circuits (important for wireless power & RF work).
- **RF Behavior**: When electricity moves fast enough, it turns into a radio wave (wireless energy = controlled RF transmission).

ðŸ“Œ **Immediate Next Step:** Learn to measure **impedance** and **experiment with small RF circuits** before moving up to wireless power.
