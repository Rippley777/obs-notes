## Schematic Reading (Memorization Plan)**

### 📌 **What You Need to Know**

- **Symbols**: Resistor (zig-zag line), Capacitor (parallel plates), Inductor (looped coil), Transistor (three legs), etc.
- **Connections**: How things are wired in series vs. parallel.
- **Voltage & Current Paths**: Where power flows and how it’s controlled.

### 🏁 **Fast Learning Approach**

- **Step 1:** Download a circuit symbols cheat sheet and reference it as you go. (I’ll help you find a good one.)
- **Step 2:** Read **actual schematics** while looking at real-world circuit boards (even old electronics).
- **Step 3:** **Recreate simple circuits** from schematics on a breadboard or simulator (like Falstad or LTspice).

🔗 **Goal:** Within a few days, you should be able to **read most basic schematics without needing a key**.
