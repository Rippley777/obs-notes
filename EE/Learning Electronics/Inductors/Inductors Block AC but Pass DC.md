Think of an inductor as a **coil of wire that stores energy in a magnetic field**.

1. **In a DC Circuit (Direct Current)**:
    
    - At first, an inductor **resists changes in current** (it "fights" the initial surge).
    - Once current is **steady**, the inductor just acts like a **plain wire** (low resistance).
    - This means **DC flows freely**.
2. **In an AC Circuit (Alternating Current)**:
    
    - AC voltage is **constantly changing direction**, which means **current is always trying to change**.
    - Inductors **resist changes in current** by generating an opposing voltage (**back EMF**).
    - The faster the AC changes (higher frequency), the **more the inductor resists the current**.
    - At high enough frequencies, the inductor **almost completely blocks the AC**.

ðŸ”¹ **TL;DR:** Inductors **allow DC to pass**, but for AC, they act like a **resistance that increases with frequency** (blocking high-frequency signals).
