These two laws are **critical** for understanding how circuits behave:

#### **âš¡ Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL)**

- The **sum of currents entering a junction = sum of currents leaving a junction**.
- Like water pipes: **What flows in must flow out** (no charge disappears).
- Example: If 3A flows into a node and splits into two paths of **1A & 2A**, it balances out.

#### **âš¡ Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL)**

- The **sum of voltage drops in a closed loop must be zero**.
- If a **battery provides 9V**, all components (resistors, LEDs, etc.) must drop **exactly 9V** total.

ðŸ”¹ **Why does this matter?**  
KVL & KCL help you **calculate unknown voltages & currents**, essential for designing and troubleshooting circuits.
