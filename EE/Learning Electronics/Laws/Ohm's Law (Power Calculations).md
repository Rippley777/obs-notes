### **Ohm’s Law & Power Calculations**

![[ohms_law_equation.png]]
- If you know **any two values (V, I, R)**, you can solve for the third.

#### **⚡ Power Formula**

- Measured in **watts (W)**.
- If a **12V circuit** pulls **2A**, the power used is: 12V×2A=24W
- Useful for calculating **battery life, heating effects, and circuit efficiency**
