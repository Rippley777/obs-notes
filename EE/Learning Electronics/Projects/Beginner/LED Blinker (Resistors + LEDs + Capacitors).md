**Goal:** Understand current limiting, resistance, and simple timing with capacitors.

#### 🧩 **How It Works:**

- A resistor limits the current to the LED (so it doesn’t fry itself).
- A capacitor charges and discharges to create a simple blinking effect.

**🛠️ Components:**

- 1x LED (any color)
- 1x 220Ω resistor (current limiting)
- 1x 100µF capacitor (controls blink timing)
- 1x 5V power source (USB, battery, or Arduino)

**🔌 Wiring:**

- Power → **Resistor** → **LED** → Ground
- Add the capacitor parallel to the LED for timing control.

💡 **What You Learn:**

- How resistors control current.
- How capacitors store and release energy.
- Polarity basics for LEDs and electrolytic capacitors.
