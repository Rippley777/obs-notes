**Goal:** Use a capacitor and your finger to create a touch-sensitive switch.

#### 🧩 **How It Works:**

- Touching the capacitor changes its capacitance, which a comparator or microcontroller detects.

**🛠️ Components:**

- 1x Capacitor (10nF)
- 1x Resistor (1MΩ)
- 1x LED
- 1x 555 Timer or Arduino
- 1x Power source

**🔌 Wiring:**

- Connect the capacitor to ground and one input of the timer/comparator.
- Your finger adds capacitance, changing the signal and toggling the LED.

💡 **What You Learn:**

- How capacitors work as **sensors**.
- **Comparator circuits** and sensitivity adjustments.
