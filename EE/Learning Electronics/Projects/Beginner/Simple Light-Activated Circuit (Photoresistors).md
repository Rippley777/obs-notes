**Goal:** Explore how sensors work by making a circuit that responds to light.

#### 🧩 **How It Works:**

- A **photoresistor (LDR)** changes resistance based on light intensity.
- When it gets dark, the LED turns on (or vice versa).

**🛠️ Components:**

- 1x Photoresistor (LDR)
- 1x LED
- 1x 10kΩ resistor
- 1x 5V power source

**🔌 Wiring:**

- Connect the LDR and a 10kΩ resistor in series between **VCC** and **GND**.
- Connect the junction between them to the base of an NPN transistor to switch the LED on/off.

💡 **What You Learn:**

- How sensors convert environmental conditions into electrical signals.
- The behavior of **voltage dividers** (LDR + resistor).
- Basic transistor switching.
