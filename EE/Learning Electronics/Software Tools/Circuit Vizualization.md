- **Falstad Circuit Simulator** – Real-time interactive simulations.
- EveryCircuit – Mobile-friendly circuit playground.
- **LTspice** – Industry-standard for advanced analysis.
- Pspice


## Update: FUCK LTSpice and Probably PSpice too

Terms and service agreement says:
- Analog Devices claims a **license to any related patents**. If your company holds patents related to circuit simulation, **this could be problematic**.
- The **audit clause** is pretty aggressive for freeware—it suggests they take licensing enforcement very seriously.
- The **feedback clause** feels overreaching: even casual comments or suggestions become their intellectual property.

### ⚔️ **LTSpice vs. PSpice: The Showdown**

**TL;DR:** **LTSpice** is probably your best bet.

|⚡ **Feature**|🛠️ **LTSpice**|🔍 **PSpice**|
|---|---|---|
|**Cost**|🆓 **Free** (by Analog Devices)|💰 **Limited free**; full = $$$|
|**Ease of Use**|⚙️ Steeper learning curve, but powerful|📖 More user-friendly interface|
|**Simulation Speed**|🚀 **Fast** for analog simulations|🐢 Slower, especially large circuits|
|**Component Models**|🎯 Best for Analog Devices' parts|🔗 Larger variety of component models|
|**Community/Docs**|🤝 Strong hobbyist community|📘 More enterprise-oriented|
|**Advanced Analysis**|📉 Great for analog/RF work|🧠 Stronger for mixed-signal/digital|
|**OS Support**|🐧 Runs great on Linux w/ Wine|🪟 Primarily Windows-focused|

**Verdict:**

- **LTSpice** if you're experimenting with coils, inductors, and analog circuits. It’s perfect for Tesla coil simulations and won’t cost a dime.
- **PSpice** if you start designing more complex mixed-signal circuits with microcontrollers and want more industry-standard libraries—but probably overkill for your wireless energy experiments.

7. ### ⚙️ **Qucs-S (Linux/MacOS via workarounds)** – **Simulation Specialist**
    
    - Primarily designed for Linux; MacOS requires some fiddling (Wine or custom build).
    - Powerful SPICE-based simulator with **Ngspice & Xyce** integration.
    - Focused purely on simulation, so less bloat compared to full EDA suites.
    - **Package managers:** Linux install via `apt install qucs` (Debian/Ubuntu) or build from source.
    - **Verdict:** **Great for simulations**, but MacOS users might hit some roadblocks.

---

8. ### 🚀 **Ngspice (MacOS/Linux)** – **SPICE Purist**
    
    - Lightweight, command-line-based simulator (CLI-heavy but powerful).
    - Works natively on Linux and MacOS (Intel & Apple Silicon).
    - **Integrates easily with KiCad** if you want a GUI.
    - **Package managers:** `brew install ngspice` (MacOS) or `apt install ngspice` (Linux).
    - **Verdict:** If you're comfortable in the CLI and just need **pure simulation** without GUI fluff, **Ngspice is solid**.

9. ### 🛠️ **[Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) (MacOS/Linux)** – **Hobbyist-Friendly**
    
    - Native support on MacOS/Linux but **less robust simulation**.
    - Great for **breadboard prototyping** and PCB design.
    - **Ideal for quick educational demos** or beginner-level projects.
    - **Package managers:** Available via `brew install fritzing` on MacOS or Linux package managers.
    - **Verdict:** Good for **simple or educational projects**, but **not as strong** for hardcore circuit sims.

---

10. ### 🔬 **Xyce (Linux)** – **The Powerhouse**
    
    - **Linux-first**, but MacOS possible with manual build steps.
    - Developed by **Sandia National Labs**—crazy performance with **parallel SPICE simulations**.
    - **Ideal for advanced, large-scale circuit analysis**.
    - **Package managers:** Source build only (requires more setup).
