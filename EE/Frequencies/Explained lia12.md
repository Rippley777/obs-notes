Imagine you're throwing a rock into a pond. When the rock hits the water, it creates ripples that spread out. Those ripples are like **radio waves**—invisible waves that travel through the air, carrying information like music, phone calls, and Wi-Fi signals.

### **What is Frequency?**

Now, imagine you keep throwing rocks into the pond, one after another. If you throw one rock per second, the ripples spread out slowly. But if you throw **10 rocks per second**, the ripples happen much faster.

- **How often something happens per second is called "frequency."**
- It's measured in **Hertz (Hz)**, which just means "times per second."

### **Examples of Frequency:**

- **1 Hz** = 1 wave per second
- **100 Hz** = 100 waves per second
- **1,000,000 Hz (1 MHz)** = 1 million waves per second
- **2,400,000,000 Hz (2.4 GHz)** = 2.4 billion waves per second (same as Wi-Fi!)

### **What Do Radio Waves Do?**

Radio waves are just really fast-moving ripples, but instead of water, they travel through **air, space, and even walls**. They are used for:

- **Radios** (like FM radio at 100 MHz)
- **TV signals**
- **Wi-Fi & Bluetooth**
- **Cell phones**
- **Walkie-talkies**
- **GPS**
- **Airplane communication**

### **Low vs. High Frequency**

- **Low-frequency waves (big, slow ripples)** travel far but carry less information. (Example: AM radio)
- **High-frequency waves (small, fast ripples)** carry more information but don’t travel as far. (Example: Wi-Fi, 5G)
