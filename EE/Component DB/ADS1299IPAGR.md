- Monitor DRDY line to synchronize data acquisition.

## Practical Application Guide

### Recommended Circuit Configuration

- **Power Supply:** Dual 3.3 V (Analog) and 5 V (Digital) with proper decoupling capacitors.
- **Input Setup:** Differential electrode pairs with appropriate filtering.
- **Reference Electrode:** Connect BIASOUT to patient reference electrode with safety isolation.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If no data output, check SPI communication and verify chip select operation.
- For excessive noise, ensure electrodes and shielded cables are correctly installed.
- If channel gain is incorrect, reprogram gain settings and verify input connections.
