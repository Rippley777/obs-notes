    - Measure delay between object movement and sensor response.

## Usage Notes

- Use shielded cables to minimize EMI.
- Ensure sensor coils are properly aligned with the target.
- Calibrate sensor periodically for accurate measurements.

## Practical Application Guide

### Recommended Circuit Configuration

- **Power Supply:** Provide a clean 3.3 V regulated source.
- **I2C Interface:** Use 4.7 kΩ pull-up resistors for SDA and SCL.
- **Sensor Coil:** Select inductors within the sensor’s frequency range.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If no readings, verify I2C address and line continuity.
- If readings are unstable, check shielding and coil placement.
- For drift issues, recalibrate using the reference capacitor method.

### Safety Considerations

- Avoid exposure to strong magnetic fields during operation.
- Handle with ESD-safe equipment.
- Keep coils away from high-voltage sources.
