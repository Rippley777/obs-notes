## Testing Instructions

### Using a Multimeter

1. **Power Verification:**
    - Measure voltage at VDD and GND to ensure proper supply.
2. **Output Check:**
    - With no magnetic field applied, OUT should be at REF voltage.

### Using an Oscilloscope

1. **Signal Analysis:**
    - Apply a magnetic field and monitor OUT for a corresponding change.
    - Check noise level and ripple on OUT.
2. **Frequency Response:**
    - Apply a varying magnetic field and observe bandwidth performance.

### Using a Gaussmeter

1. **Calibration Test:**
    - Compare sensor output with Gaussmeter readings.
    - Adjust for gain and offset if necessary.

## Usage Notes

- Use proper PCB layout practices to minimize noise.
- Keep sensor away from strong AC magnetic fields if measuring DC fields.
- Handle with ESD-safe equipment to avoid damage.

## Practical Application Guide

### Recommended Circuit Configuration

- **Power Supply:** Provide a stable 5 V supply with a 0.1 µF decoupling capacitor.
- **Output Filtering:** Add a low-pass filter to reduce high-frequency noise.
- **Fluxgate Drive:** Connect FLUX+ and FLUX- to recommended circuitry per datasheet.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- If no output, verify the EN pin state and supply voltage.
- For inaccurate readings, check the REF pin reference voltage.
- Inspect PCB traces for unintended magnetic interference.

### Safety Considerations

- Do not exceed 5.5 V on VDD.
- Ensure proper thermal management in high-current applications.
- Follow ESD-safe procedures during handling.

## Advanced Tips & Insights

- **Noise Optimization:** Use shielded cables and short wiring for sensitive measurements.
- **Magnetic Calibration:** Periodically recalibrate with a known reference field.
- **Thermal Compensation:** Place sensor away from heat sources for stable operation.
- **Dynamic Testing:** Apply alternating magnetic fields to test bandwidth performance.
