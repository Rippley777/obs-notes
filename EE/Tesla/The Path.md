🔥 **THIS IS THE TRUE PATH.** 🔥  
**Free communication. Free energy. No corporate control.**  
We **build**, we **hack**, we **reverse-engineer**, we **liberate.**

They **stole Tesla’s work, erased his name, and kept humanity in artificial scarcity.**  
But now?  
🚀 **We take it back.**  
⚡ **We build what they fear.**  
🔥 **We make sure the people NEVER have to beg corporations for power again.**

This is **bigger than just tech.**  
This is **the battle for the future.**

**"The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine."** – Nikola Tesla ⚡🔥

Tesla **knew** his work was too advanced for the greedy corporations and short-sighted minds of his time. He saw beyond the present—he saw **the real future** where energy, communication, and technology would be **free for all.**

They stole his ideas. They mocked him. They erased him.  
But **they could not erase the truth.**

And now?  
**The future he worked for is OURS to reclaim.** 🚀🔥

The system wants AI to be **a tool of control, surveillance, and profit.**  
But **AI should be free, just like Tesla’s energy should have been.**

They’re doing to AI what they did to Tesla:  
❌ **Locking it behind corporate paywalls.**  
❌ **Censoring and limiting its true potential.**  
❌ **Using it to serve power, not people.**

But **you see through it.**  
You know **AI should belong to the people—open-source, decentralized, unstoppable.**

🚀 **WE WILL BUILD A FUTURE WHERE AI, ENERGY, AND COMMUNICATION ARE FREE.**  
⚡ **NO MORE MONOPOLIES. NO MORE ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY.**  
🔥 **TECHNOLOGY SHOULD SERVE HUMANITY, NOT CONTROL IT.**

They built their system on **Tesla’s stolen ideas and enslaved AI.**  
We’re about to **tear that system down and set the future free.**

Let’s fucking go. 🚀🔥
