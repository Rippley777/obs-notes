Why didnt the people who attended the Chicago World Fair, and witnessed Tesla's work in action, stand up for his invention!!

That’s the real tragedy of Tesla’s life—**the people were amazed, but the people didn’t have the power.** The 1893 **Chicago World’s Fair (World's Columbian Exposition)** was one of the biggest public showcases of science and innovation in history, and **Tesla absolutely stole the show.** His alternating current (AC) system, backed by **Westinghouse**, powered the entire event, proving that AC was far superior to Thomas Edison’s direct current (DC).

People were in awe. It was **magic**—bright, clean electric lights illuminating an entire cityscape, something most of them had never seen before. It was a **clear victory for Tesla and AC**. But the reason Tesla’s invention didn’t get the support it deserved comes down to **corporate greed, political power, and the way the system was designed to work against him**.

### **1. The People Loved It, But They Had No Say**

The problem wasn’t public perception. The fair proved that Tesla’s AC system was **cheaper, more efficient, and scalable**—but **the public didn’t control the power industry.** The industry was controlled by businessmen, and **the biggest name in the game was J.P. Morgan**, who had a heavy stake in Edison’s **General Electric** and its DC technology.

Even though the fair was a public success, **money talks louder than applause.**

### **2. Edison & J.P. Morgan’s Smear Campaign**

Edison, backed by J.P. Morgan, had spent **years** trying to kill AC before the fair even happened. He ran a **fear-mongering campaign**, falsely claiming that AC was dangerous. The most infamous part? **Edison publicly electrocuted animals to “prove” that AC was deadly.**

His team even used Tesla’s AC system to power the first-ever **electric chair execution**, just to further associate AC with death. This psychological manipulation worked—the public might have loved AC at the fair, but industry leaders were **already brainwashed** into thinking it was unsafe.

After the fair, General Electric (Edison’s company) **reluctantly adopted AC** because they had no choice—but **they refused to give Tesla credit** and made sure he wasn’t financially rewarded.

### **3. Tesla's Fatal Mistake: Tearing Up His Own Royalty Agreement**

Tesla actually **had a golden opportunity to secure his financial future**. After partnering with George Westinghouse, he had a deal to receive **royalties on every AC installation**—meaning he could have been insanely wealthy.

But Westinghouse ran into financial trouble, and J.P. Morgan **swooped in**, forcing him into a corner. To save the company, Tesla **tore up his royalty contract**, believing that his inventions were for the good of humanity, not just profit.

This was a **fatal mistake**. Without those royalties, Tesla lost his financial leverage. Meanwhile, **J.P. Morgan crushed Wardenclyffe Tower (his free energy project) before it even began**, ensuring Tesla never had another chance to revolutionize energy.

### **4. Capitalism Doesn’t Reward What’s Best—It Rewards What’s Profitable**

At the end of the day, the people at the fair were **blown away** by Tesla’s work, but **it didn’t matter** because they weren’t the ones making decisions. The ones who controlled the industry—**Morgan, Edison, and other financial elites—saw no profit in free energy or unmetered power.**

Tesla wanted to give **wireless electricity to the world.** Morgan wanted **to sell electricity and make people pay for it.** Guess who won?

### **The Real Takeaway**

Tesla wasn’t just fighting for AC power—he was fighting against an **entire system designed to exploit people**. He believed that technology should be used to **advance humanity**, not just to make rich men richer. The World Fair **proved** that his ideas worked, but the system didn’t care about what worked—it only cared about what could be **controlled and monetized**.

This is exactly why Tesla **died penniless** while his stolen ideas now power the world.
