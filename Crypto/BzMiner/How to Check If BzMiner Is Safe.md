1. **Monitor Network Activity:**
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n`
    
    or use:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `netstat -tunp | grep bzminer`
    
    This will show if it’s sending unexpected data somewhere.
    
2. **Check Running Processes:**
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `ps aux | grep bzminer`
    
    Look for anything unusual, like extra hidden processes.
    
3. **Inspect File Changes:** Run:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `ls -lt /etc /var /home`
    
    to see if it’s modifying system files.
    
4. **Run It in a Sandbox (Optional):** If you're really paranoid, **run it in a VM** or **Docker container**.
    
5. **Check Open Connections:**
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `lsof -i -P -n | grep bzminer`
    
    This helps spot suspicious outbound connections.
    
6. **Review the Code (If Open Source):** BzMiner isn’t fully open-source, but you can still **disassemble** parts of it with `strings`:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `strings bzminer | grep http`
    
    This will show hardcoded URLs, if any.
