# Best Practices for Managing Users on a Shared Server

Managing users on a shared server requires careful attention to security and operational efficiency. Below are some best practices to follow:

## 1. **Use Non-Root Users**
- Avoid logging in as `root` for regular tasks.
- Create individual non-root users for administrative and operational activities.

## 2. **Implement Principle of Least Privilege**
- Assign users only the permissions necessary for their role.
- Use groups to manage permissions effectively, e.g., `webusers` for managing web content.

## 3. **Enable SSH Key Authentication**
- Disable password-based SSH logins.
- Require users to use SSH keys for authentication:
  ```bash
  PermitRootLogin no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  ```
- Store public keys in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for each user.

## 4. **Regularly Audit User Accounts**
- Periodically review user accounts and remove unused accounts:
  ```bash
  sudo userdel <username>
  sudo rm -r /home/<username>
  ```
- Check for unexpected accounts:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/passwd
  ```

## 5. **Restrict Root Access**
- Disable direct root login via SSH.
- Use `sudo` for privilege escalation and log all commands.

## 6. **Log and Monitor User Activities**
- Enable logging of user actions for accountability:
  ```bash
  sudo visudo
  ```
  Add:
  ```bash
  Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo.log"
  ```
- Use tools like `auditd` for advanced monitoring.

## 7. **Use Quotas to Limit Resource Usage**
- Prevent users from consuming excessive disk space:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install quota
  sudo edquota -u <username>
  ```

## 8. **Isolate Users**
- Prevent users from accessing each otherâ€™s files:
  ```bash
  chmod 750 /home/<username>
  ```
- Consider using tools like `chroot` or containers for stricter isolation.

## 9. **Regularly Update and Patch Software**
- Keep the system updated to minimize vulnerabilities:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  ```

## 10. **Enforce Strong Password Policies**
- Require strong passwords and enforce rotation:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
  sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf
  ```
  Example configuration:
  ```
  minlen = 12
  dcredit = -1
  ucredit = -1
  lcredit = -1
  ocredit = -1
  ```

## 11. **Backup User Data Regularly**
- Automate backups of important user data:
  ```bash
  tar -czvf /backup/users-$(date +%F).tar.gz /home/
  ```

## 12. **Educate Users**
- Train users on best practices, including:
  - Secure password creation.
  - Recognizing phishing attacks.
  - Avoiding unsafe commands.

By following these practices, you can ensure a secure and efficient user management system on a shared server.
