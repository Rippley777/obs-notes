# Keys and Credentials: Best Practices for Maintaining a Secure Online Network

## What Are Keys and Credentials?

- **Keys**: Keys refer to cryptographic tools used to encrypt or decrypt data. Examples include API keys, private keys in public-key cryptography, and symmetric keys.
- **Credentials**: Credentials are pieces of information used for authentication, such as usernames, passwords, tokens, or certificates.

## Best Practices for Keys and Credentials

### 1. **Keep Keys and Credentials Secret**
- Store keys and credentials in secure environments, such as environment variables or secret management tools.
- ~~Avoid~~ **Never get caught** hardcoding them into your source code.
- Use `.env` and `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive files from being tracked in version control systems.

### 2. **Use Secret Management Tools**
- Use tools like **HashiCorp Vault**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, or **Azure Key Vault** to securely store and manage keys and credentials.
- These tools provide encryption at rest, role-based access control, and audit logging.

### 3. **Rotate Keys and Credentials Regularly**
- Periodically rotate API keys, access tokens, and passwords to limit exposure in case of a breach.
- Automate key rotation where possible to reduce manual errors.

### 4. **Use Principle of Least Privilege**
- Grant only the permissions necessary for the task at hand.
- Restrict API keys or tokens to specific IP addresses, services, or environments.

### 5. **Monitor and Audit Usage**
- Enable logging and monitoring for all key and credential usage.
- Look for unusual patterns such as unauthorized access attempts or usage from unexpected locations.

### 6. **Use Strong Authentication**
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accounts that manage keys and credentials.
- Use modern authentication protocols such as OAuth2 for applications.

### 7. **Encrypt Keys at Rest and in Transit**
- Use encryption protocols like TLS/SSL to protect keys and credentials during transmission.
- Store them encrypted using algorithms such as AES-256 when at rest.

### 8. **Segregate Environments**
- Use separate keys and credentials for development, staging, and production environments.
- Avoid sharing credentials across multiple environments.

### 9. **Secure Your Source Code**
- Use tools like **GitGuardian** or **truffleHog** to scan your repositories for exposed keys or credentials.
- Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

### 10. **Handle Key Exposure Immediately**
- Revoke and replace exposed keys or credentials immediately.
- Investigate the cause of exposure and take steps to prevent future occurrences.

## Examples of Secure Practices

### Example 1: Environment Variables
```env
# .env file
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
- Load these variables using libraries like `dotenv` in Node.js or Python.

### Example 2: Restricted API Keys
```json
{
  "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
  "restrictions": {
    "ip_whitelist": ["192.168.1.1"],
    "read_only": true
  }
}
```
- Define restrictions to limit the scope of your API key.

## Tools and Resources

- **Secret Scanning**: GitGuardian, truffleHog, Snyk
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault
- **Encryption Libraries**: OpenSSL, Libsodium, Crypto modules in various programming languages

## Summary
By following these best practices, you can greatly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information and protect your online network from potential threats. Always be vigilant and proactive in maintaining a secure environment for your keys and credentials.
