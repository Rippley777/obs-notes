### **Insomnia**

Insomnia is a robust API client that provides similar functionalities to Postman. It's particularly favored for its minimalistic interface and ease of use. Insomnia supports REST, GraphQL, and gRPC APIs, making it versatile for various types of API testing. It also offers features like environment variables, response viewing, and request chaining.

### 2. **Swagger UI / OpenAPI Tools**

Swagger UI, part of the Swagger suite of API tools, allows you to visualize and interact with API resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s great for designing APIs according to the OpenAPI Specification. Swagger also offers tools for generating client libraries, server stubs, API documentation, and other essential parts of a RESTful API.

### 3. **SoapUI**

Although it's more focused on SOAP services, SoapUI also supports RESTful APIs and is widely used for functional testing, especially in enterprise environments. SoapUI allows for extensive testing automation, making it suitable for complex test scenarios and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

### 4. **Paw**

Paw is a Mac-native HTTP client that helps you test and describe the APIs you build or consume. It has a full-featured visual editor and supports building HTTP requests, inspecting server responses, generating client code, and even comparing API responses.

### 5. **cURL**

cURL is a command-line tool used to transfer data with URLs. Although not as user-friendly or feature-rich as graphical tools like Postman, cURL is powerful for quick checks and automation scripts. It’s widely supported and can handle a multitude of protocols, making it a staple in many developers' toolkits.

### 6. **HTTPie**

HTTPie is another command-line tool aimed at making CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple http command that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a straightforward and natural syntax, and it displays colorized output.

### 7. **JMeter**

Primarily a load testing tool, Apache JMeter can also be used for API testing. It can be used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources and can simulate a heavy load on a server to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.

### 8. **Advanced REST Client (ARC)**

ARC is a free, open-source tool for testing HTTP requests. You can build your HTTP requests through its interface, similar to Postman, with support for customizing headers, payloads, and viewing responses.

### 9. **Fiddler**

Fiddler is a web debugging tool that captures HTTP traffic between chosen computers and the Internet. It allows for inspecting traffic, setting breakpoints, and "fiddling" with incoming or outgoing data. Fiddler also includes a powerful event-based scripting subsystem, and can be used for both capturing and replaying requests.
