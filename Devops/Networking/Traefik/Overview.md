# Overview of Traefik

## What is Traefik?

Traefik is a modern, cloud-native **reverse proxy** and **load balancer** designed to simplify the deployment and management of microservices and containerized applications. It automatically discovers services and dynamically configures itself to route traffic to them, making it a popular choice in environments like **Kubernetes**, **Docker Swarm**, and standalone **Docker Compose** setups.

## Key Features of Traefik

1. **Dynamic Service Discovery**
    
    - Traefik automatically detects services via providers like Docker, Kubernetes, and Consul.
2. **Load Balancing**
    
    - Traefik distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service, supporting strategies like round-robin and sticky sessions.
3. **Automatic SSL/TLS**
    
    - Integrates with Let's Encrypt to automatically issue and renew SSL certificates.
4. **Middleware**
    
    - Supports request transformations, authentication, rate-limiting, retries, and more via middleware.
5. **Observability**
    
    - Provides metrics, logs, and tracing via tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger.
6. **Built-in Dashboard**
    
    - Includes a web UI for monitoring configurations, services, and traffic.
7. **Multiple Protocols**
    
    - Supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and UDP, enabling routing for diverse applications.

## Key Components of Traefik

1. **EntryPoints**
    
    - Define how Traefik receives incoming requests (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, TCP).
    - Example configuration:
        
        ```yaml
        entryPoints:
          web:
            address: ":80"
          websecure:
            address: ":443"
        ```
        
2. **Routers**
    
    - Match incoming requests and determine how they are handled (e.g., routing to specific services or applying middleware).
    - Example:
        
        ```yaml
        http:
          routers:
            my-router:
              rule: "Host(`example.com`)"
              service: "my-service"
        ```
        
3. **Services**
    
    - Define the backend services that Traefik routes traffic to.
    - Example:
        
        ```yaml
        http:
          services:
            my-service:
              loadBalancer:
                servers:
                  - url: "http://localhost:8080"
        ```
        
4. **Middleware**
    
    - Modify requests/responses (e.g., add headers, enable authentication).
    - Example:
        
        ```yaml
        http:
          middlewares:
            my-auth:
              basicAuth:
                users:
                  - "user:password"
        ```
        
5. **Providers**
    
    - Sources of dynamic configuration, such as Docker, Kubernetes, or static files.
    - Example for Docker:
        
        ```yaml
        providers:
          docker:
            exposedByDefault: false
        ```

## How Traefik Works

1. **Request Flow**
    
    - Incoming requests hit an **entryPoint** (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS).
    - **Routers** match the request to a rule (e.g., host or path).
    - The request may pass through one or more **middlewares**.
    - The router forwards the request to a **service** (load balancer, backend).
2. **Dynamic Configuration**
    
    - Traefik automatically discovers services via providers and updates its configuration without restarts.

## Example Traefik with Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.10
    command:
      - "--providers.docker"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.tlschallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.email=your-email@example.com"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.myresolver.acme.storage=/acme.json"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"
      - "./acme.json:/acme.json"

  app:
    image: nginx:alpine
    labels:
      - "traefik.http.routers.app.rule=Host(`example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.app.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
```
