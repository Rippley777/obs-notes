### Option 1: Find and Stop the Service Using Port 8080

1. **Identify which process is using port 8080**: You can use the following command to see which process is using port 8080:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :8080

```


```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :8080

```

**Stop the process**: Once you identify the process, you can stop it. If itâ€™s a service, you can stop it with:


```bash
sudo systemctl stop <service-name>

```

Alternatively, if it's a regular process, you might want to kill it:


```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>

```

1. Replace `<PID>` with the process ID from the output of the previous command.
    

### Option 2: Change the Port in Your Docker Compose File

If you prefer not to stop the service using port 8080 or if you need that service to keep running, you can configure your Docker container to use a different port.

1. **Edit your `docker-compose.yml` file**: Change the ports configuration to map a different external port to the internal port 8080. For example, if you want to use port 8081 on your host machine, modify it like this:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8081:8080"

```

**Run Docker Compose again**: After saving the changes, run:


```bash
docker-compose up --build

```

1. Now, your application should be accessible at `http://localhost:8081`.
    

### Option 3: Use Docker Compose to Automatically Find an Available Port

If you don't want to manually specify ports and prefer Docker to automatically assign an available port, you can use the following configuration:



```bash
ports:
  - "8080"
```

This will bind the internal port 8080 to a random available port on the host. You can find out which port has been assigned by looking at the output of `docker-compose up` or by running:


```bash
docker ps
```

This command will show the port mapping under the "PORTS" column.

Any of these methods will help you resolve the port conflict and allow your Docker container to start successfully. Choose the one that best suits your situation.
