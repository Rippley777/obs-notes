### **1. Secure Your Home Network**

Before exposing anything to the outside world:

- **Set up a VLAN**: Segment your network so the gaming rig and devices for external access are isolated from your primary home network.
- **Enable Firewall Rules**: Configure your router or firewall to only allow traffic between VLANs where absolutely necessary.
- **Use Strong Authentication**: Make sure all devices on your network, including your router, use strong passwords and are running the latest firmware.

### **2. Use a WAF for External Access**

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) can act as a gateway to your gaming rig while filtering malicious traffic. Here's how you can use a cloud WAF:

- **Choose a Provider**: Azure Front Door, AWS WAF, or Cloudflare can act as a WAF to filter incoming requests.
- **Set Up Reverse Proxy**: Configure the WAF to route traffic to your home network through a secure tunnel.
- **Enforce TLS/SSL**: Ensure all communication is encrypted using HTTPS.

### **3. Host Your Gaming Rig Behind a Bastion Service**

Rather than exposing the rig directly:

- **Set Up a VPN**: Host a VPN server on your home network or use cloud providers like OpenVPN Cloud. This creates a secure tunnel for accessing your gaming rig.
- **SSH Bastion Host**: If you're comfortable with command-line tools, set up an SSH bastion on Azure or DigitalOcean. You can connect to this bastion to proxy into your local network.

### **4. Route Traffic Through a Cloud Service**

To keep your home IP hidden and secure:

- **Use a Reverse SSH Tunnel**: Create a persistent SSH connection from your gaming rig to a cloud server (e.g., DigitalOcean Droplet). The cloud server will act as the access point for external connections.
- **Set Up a Proxy or Gateway**: Use tools like `nginx` or `Caddy` on your cloud server to proxy traffic to your gaming rig.

---

### **5. Monitor and Maintain Security**

- **Monitor Traffic**: Use tools like Fail2Ban or cloud provider firewalls to block repeated failed attempts.
- **Set Up Intrusion Detection**: Use something like Suricata or Snort for network monitoring.
- **Automate Updates**: Keep your gaming rig and any exposed services up-to-date to patch vulnerabilities.

### **Example Architecture**

1. **Gaming Rig**:
    
    - Connect to a VLAN for AI services.
    - Run a lightweight reverse proxy like `nginx` or `traefik` for internal service routing.
2. **Cloud Gateway (DigitalOcean)**:
    
    - Set up an SSH tunnel to the gaming rig.
    - Use a WAF (e.g., Cloudflare or Azure Front Door) to filter requests.
3. **Secure Access**:
    
    - Expose only required ports/services.
    - Use a VPN for administrative access to the gaming rig.

### Tools Youâ€™ll Need

- **VPN**: OpenVPN, WireGuard, or cloud-hosted VPN.
- **Firewall**: UFW (on the rig) or pfSense for your home network.
- **WAF**: Azure Front Door, Cloudflare, or AWS WAF.
