If you're running into persistent issues with SSH on Debian Secure, and you're considering starting over, it's understandable. Before you take that step, hereâ€™s a consolidated approach to troubleshoot and reset SSH:

---

### **1. Verify Your System**

- **Confirm OS Version:**
    `lsb_release -a uname -a`
    
    Ensure you're using the correct Debian Secure build and not a heavily modified version causing unexpected behavior.
- **Check Disk Space:** If your root filesystem is full, services like SSH might behave unpredictably:
    
    `df -h`
    

---

### **2. Purge and Reinstall OpenSSH Server**

1. Completely remove the SSH server:
  
    `sudo apt purge openssh-server sudo rm -rf /etc/ssh`
    
2. Reinstall OpenSSH server:

    `sudo apt update sudo apt install openssh-server`
    
3. Start the SSH service:
 
    `sudo systemctl enable ssh sudo systemctl start ssh`
    
4. Confirm the service is running:
   
    `sudo systemctl status ssh`
    

---

### **3. Restore Default Configuration**

1. Reset the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to its default:
  
    `sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server`
    
2. Minimal working configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):

    `Port 22 PermitRootLogin no PubkeyAuthentication yes PasswordAuthentication no AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys`
    
3. Validate the configuration:

    `sudo sshd -t`
    
4. Restart SSH:
 
    `sudo systemctl restart ssh`
    

---

### **4. Confirm Key-Based Authentication**

1. **Check Key Setup on Your Client:**

    `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    
    - Ensure the key exists. If not, regenerate:
    
        `ssh-keygen`
        
2. **Copy the Key to the Raspberry Pi:**
    
    - Simplest way:
    
        `ssh-copy-id pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP>`
        
    - If that fails, copy it manually:

        `scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP>:/home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys`
        
3. **Set Correct Permissions on the Pi:**

    `chmod 700 ~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
    
4. **Test SSH Key Login:**
    
    `ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP>`
    

---

### **5. Debug Connection Issues**

- **Verbose SSH Client Output:**

    `ssh -vvv pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP>`
    
    - Look for issues like "permission denied" or "no keys found."
- **Check Logs on the Pi:**
 
    `sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log`
    
    - Errors here will give precise reasons for the failure.

---

### **6. Consider Wiping and Starting Fresh**

If none of this resolves the issue:

1. **Backup your data.**
2. Use a **standard Raspberry Pi OS** (Debian-based) or a clean Debian image to ensure no pre-applied security layers are interfering with configuration.
3. Flash a new image using tools like Raspberry Pi Imager or `dd`.

---

### **Alternative: Test SSH Without Modifications**

If you do a fresh install:

1. Enable SSH by placing an `ssh` file in the `/boot` directory.
2. Ensure you can connect via:

    `ssh pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP>`
    
3. Gradually lock down the system.


### **What Likely Went Wrong:**

1. **Modified Defaults:**
    
    - Debian Secure or a previous configuration might have adjusted default SSH settings or permissions, leading to incompatibilities.
2. **Permissions Problems:**
    
    - SSH is very picky about permissions for security reasons. If `~/.ssh` or `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` had incorrect permissions, SSH would silently fail.
3. **Corrupted SSH Installation:**
    
    - A misconfigured or partial SSH installation could prevent the service from working correctly, especially if custom security policies were involved.
4. **System-Level Config Conflicts:**
    
    - Conflicting files in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf` might have overridden your settings.
5. **Lingering Issues in Old Config Files:**
    
    - Even if you edited the config, subtle typos or leftover directives could cause issues. A clean reset to default eliminates this.

### **Why the Fix Worked:**

1. **Purge and Reinstall:**
    
    - Completely removing and reinstalling OpenSSH ensured a clean slate, wiping out any corrupted configurations or incompatible files.
2. **Minimal Config Reset:**
    
    - Starting with the simplest working configuration eliminated unnecessary variables and brought SSH back to basics.
3. **Proper Key Setup:**
    
    - Manually re-adding keys and setting permissions resolved potential issues with the `authorized_keys` file.
4. **Validation and Logs:**
    
    - Running `sshd -t` and checking logs ensured the new config was functional before restarting.

### **Lessons for the Future:**

- When working with hardened OS builds, always review and understand pre-applied security measures.
- Keep configurations minimal and add enhancements incrementally.
- Always check permissions for `.ssh` directories and key files when debugging SSH.
