To achieve this, you can configure an Azure endpoint to call different databases based on whether it's in production or staging by leveraging environment-specific settings. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. **Use Azure App Configuration or App Settings**

- Define connection strings for both production and staging databases as environment variables.
- In Azure App Service or Azure Functions:
    1. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab.
    2. Add environment-specific settings:
        - **For Production:** `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING = ProdConnectionString`
        - **For Staging:** `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING = StagingConnectionString`

### 2. **Access Configuration in Code**

- In your application code, retrieve the environment variable that corresponds to the connection string:
    
    javascript
    
    Copy code
    
    `// Node.js Example const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING;  const dbClient = new DatabaseClient(connectionString);`
    
- Ensure your application reads the correct environment variable depending on the deployment slot (production or staging).

### 3. **Use Deployment Slots**

- Azure App Service supports **deployment slots** (e.g., `Production`, `Staging`).
- Assign the correct environment variables to each slot:
    - In the **Production slot**, set the production database connection string.
    - In the **Staging slot**, set the staging database connection string.

### 4. **Switch Databases Dynamically (Optional)**

- If the logic for deciding which database to call must occur dynamically within the app (e.g., testing or custom logic):
    
    javascript
    
    Copy code
    
    `const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV; // 'production' or 'staging'  const connectionString = environment === 'production'   ? process.env.PROD_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING   : process.env.STAGING_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING;  const dbClient = new DatabaseClient(connectionString);`
    

### 5. **Testing Locally**

- Use `.env` files with `dotenv` or similar packages to mimic Azure environment variables locally:
    
    makefile
    
    Copy code
    
    `NODE_ENV=staging PROD_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=prod_connection_string STAGING_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=staging_connection_string`
    

### 6. **Ensure Proper Security**

- Store sensitive connection strings securely using Azure Key Vault and reference them in your application configuration.

### 7. **Deploy and Validate**

- Deploy your application to the respective slots and validate that the correct database is being accessed:
    - For production: Use the production deployment slot.
    - For staging: Use the staging deployment slot.

By setting up environment-specific variables and using deployment slots, you can seamlessly switch databases based on the environment without modifying the application code for each deployment.
