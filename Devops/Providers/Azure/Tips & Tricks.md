1. **Use Azure Boards effectively**:
    
    - Utilize work items in Azure Boards to track tasks, bugs, and features. Leverage dashboards to visualize progress and use queries to filter and manage work items efficiently.
2. **Automate with Azure Pipelines**:
    
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the building, testing, and deployment of your applications. Use YAML for pipeline configuration to version control your pipeline alongside your application code.
3. **Branching strategies in Azure Repos**:
    
    - Implement a branching strategy that fits your teamâ€™s workflow, like Git Flow or trunk-based development. This helps in managing features, fixes, and releases in a controlled manner.
4. **Pull Request (PR) workflows**:
    
    - Enforce pull requests for merging changes, which allows code reviews and running automated builds/tests before integrating changes. Utilize branch policies to enforce build success and reviewer approvals before merging.
5. **Leverage Azure Artifacts**:
    
    - Use Azure Artifacts to host, share, and manage your packages within the same environment as your pipelines. It supports Maven, npm, NuGet, and more, facilitating easy package management and integration.
6. **Utilize Environment Management**:
    
    - Define and use environments in Azure Pipelines to manage deployment stages such as development, testing, and production. This allows for fine-grained control over who can deploy to which environment and keeps track of deployment history.
7. **Monitor with Application Insights**:
    
    - Integrate Application Insights into your applications to monitor their performance and troubleshoot issues in real-time. It helps in understanding the performance bottlenecks and user behavior.
8. **Wiki for documentation**:
    
    - Use Azure DevOps Wiki to maintain your project documentation alongside your code. This is great for keeping architectural decisions, setup instructions, and meeting notes easily accessible and up-to-date.
9. **Templates and cloning for reproducibility**:
    
    - Utilize existing templates or create your own for pipelines, environments, and boards to standardize and speed up setup for new projects. Cloning projects can also help in maintaining consistency across similar projects.
10. **Security and compliance**:
    
    - Ensure that your Azure DevOps setup complies with your organizational security policies. Regularly review access permissions, use service connections securely, and monitor activity logs for any unusual activities.
