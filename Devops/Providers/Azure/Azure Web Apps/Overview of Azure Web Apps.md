### 1. Code

The **Code** publish type is the traditional way to deploy applications to Azure Web Apps. This method is suitable for dynamic applications written in supported languages like .NET, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Here, you upload your code, and Azure Web App Service automatically handles the deployment, provisioning of a web server, and the necessary environment for the language and framework your application uses.

**Key Features:**

- Automatic management of the runtime environment.
- Integrated performance monitoring and scaling options.
- Built-in CI/CD support and integration with Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.
- Platform features such as authentication and authorization, custom domains, SSL certificates, and more.

### 2. Container

The **Container** publish type allows you to deploy your application as a container using Docker or another container tool. This method is suitable if you prefer to manage dependencies explicitly, require specific versions of software, or use technologies not natively supported by Azure App Service.

**Key Features:**

- Deploy applications packaged as Docker containers.
- Greater control over the operating system and software dependencies.
- Use of custom Docker images or those from public or private registries like Docker Hub or Azure Container Registry.
- Scalability features similar to the Code method but with the flexibility of container orchestration.

### 3. Static Web App

**Static Web App** is a specific service in Azure for hosting static content—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images—and for integrating with serverless APIs. This service is ideal for modern web applications that rely on client-side JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js, or static site generators like Gatsby, Hugo, or Jekyll.

**Key Features:**

- Seamless integration with GitHub and Azure DevOps for CI/CD.
- Globally distributed content for faster load times.
- Built-in authorization and authentication support.
- Automatic SSL certificates and custom domain configuration.
- Integration with Azure Functions for serverless API backends.

### Conclusion

Choosing between these publish types depends on the nature of your application:

- **Code** is best for traditional dynamic web applications needing specific runtime support directly from Azure.
- **Container** offers more flexibility and control, perfect for applications with specific dependencies or when migrating existing containerized applications.
- **Static Web App** is ideal for projects that are primarily static but may interact with APIs and benefit from modern development workflows.
