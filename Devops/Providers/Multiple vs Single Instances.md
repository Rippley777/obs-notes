### **Key Questions to Help You Decide**

1. **What’s Your Current Workload?**
    
    - Are your workloads small enough to fit comfortably on a single instance without maxing out resources (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.)?
2. **Do You Expect to Scale?**
    
    - Will your application or database grow significantly over time?
    - Do you plan to handle more users or larger datasets?
3. **How Important is Isolation?**
    
    - Do you have services that must not interfere with each other (e.g., high-security data for PostgreSQL vs. less critical Node.js tasks)?
4. **Do You Want Simplicity or Fine-Grained Control?**
    
    - Are you okay with managing multiple instances (e.g., backups, monitoring) for better optimization?
    - Or would you prefer to simplify everything on one instance?
5. **What’s Your Budget?**
    
    - Would you prefer to optimize now to save costs later, or keep things simple and scale resources as needed?

### **Scenario Comparisons**

#### **Scenario 1: Single Instance**

- **Use Case**:
    - Light to moderate workloads with minimal risk of resource contention.
    - You prioritize simplicity over perfect optimization.
- **Setup**:
    - Use Docker to isolate services (PostgreSQL, Node.js, etc.).
    - Optimize NGINX and database performance for shared resources.
- **Pros**:
    - Easier setup and maintenance.
    - Lower baseline cost.
- **Cons**:
    - Resource contention could occur if workloads spike.
    - Scaling up requires upgrading the entire instance, which may increase downtime.

#### **Scenario 2: Multiple Instances**

- **Use Case**:
    - High-traffic apps, large datasets, or resource-intensive tasks.
    - Services that need isolation for performance or security.
- **Setup**:
    - Dedicated instances:
        - One for PostgreSQL (storage and memory-optimized).
        - One for Node.js (CPU-optimized).
        - Optional: A small instance for NGINX or backups.
- **Pros**:
    - Better performance and scalability.
    - Services are isolated, reducing risk of cross-impact.
- **Cons**:
    - Higher baseline cost.
    - More complex setup and maintenance.

### **Decision Framework**

1. **Start with One Instance**:
    
    - Choose a single instance for simplicity and cost-saving during early development.
    - Use Docker to simulate multiple instances for isolation and portability.
2. **Monitor and Evaluate**:
    
    - Install monitoring tools (e.g., `htop`, Prometheus) to track CPU, RAM, and disk usage.
    - If you find one service is consistently maxing out resources, plan to split it into its own instance.
3. **Plan for Migration**:
    
    - Use Docker or Kubernetes so you can easily migrate services to separate instances if needed.
    - Keep services loosely coupled (e.g., communicate via APIs or private networking).

### **Example Starting Plan**

1. Start with **1 VM (2 vCPUs, 4GB, 75GB)**:
    - Run all services (PostgreSQL, Node.js, NGINX) on this instance using Docker.
2. Monitor usage:
    - If PostgreSQL uses too much memory, migrate it to a separate database-optimized instance.
    - If Node.js experiences high CPU usage, create a CPU-optimized instance.
