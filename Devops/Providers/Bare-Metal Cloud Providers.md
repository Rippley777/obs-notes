### Things to Consider When Choosing a Bare-Metal Provider

1. **Region**: Select a provider with data centers close to your target audience.
2. **Scalability**: Some bare-metal providers allow you to switch or upgrade configurations easily.
3. **Customization**: Look for providers offering the ability to choose specific hardware (e.g., GPUs, NVMe).
4. **Use Case**: Ensure the provider supports your workload requirements (e.g., gaming servers, machine learning, etc.).

If you want **control close to hardware**, bare-metal servers are an excellent choice. For something more **hybrid**, consider VPS providers that offer isolated environments with near-bare-metal performance (e.g., Vultr, Linode).
