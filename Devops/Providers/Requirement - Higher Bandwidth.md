### **1. Providers with Higher Bandwidth Allowances**

Consider other providers with more generous or unmetered bandwidth options:

- **Hetzner** (if international latency is acceptable): Offers servers with high or unlimited bandwidth.
- **IONOS**: Provides servers with unlimited traffic in the U.S.
- **OVHcloud**: Often includes high-bandwidth or unmetered plans at competitive pricing.

---

### **2. Compress Data Before Transfer**

To reduce bandwidth usage:

- Compress datasets before transferring:
    
    `tar -czvf dataset.tar.gz /path/to/dataset`
    
- Use tools like `rsync` with compression:
    
    `rsync -avz /path/to/data user@server:/destination/path`
    

---

### **3. Utilize Object Storage for Datasets**

Offload large datasets to cloud storage services:

- DigitalOcean Spaces, AWS S3, or Backblaze B2 allow scalable data storage with separate bandwidth pricing.
- Sync datasets to/from storage as needed rather than keeping them on the server.

---

### **4. Deploy Edge Processing**

If the bandwidth limit is related to transferring raw data:

- Preprocess and clean data locally to reduce its size before uploading to the server.
- Use incremental sync tools like `rclone` to only upload changed files.

---

### **5. Evaluate Your Actual Bandwidth Needs**

Calculate how much bandwidth you’ll realistically need:

- **Monthly data transfer formula**:
    `(Data transferred per session × Sessions per day × Days per month)`
    
- If your usage exceeds Vultr’s limits, consider splitting workloads across multiple servers.

---

### **6. Negotiate with Providers**

Some providers are flexible with bandwidth:

- Contact Vultr’s support to ask about higher bandwidth plans.
- Providers like OVHcloud or Hetzner often offer custom solutions.

---

### **7. Plan for Data Sharding**

Distribute datasets across multiple locations:

- Use a multi-cloud approach to split data storage and processing across different providers.
- Transfer smaller chunks of data within individual bandwidth limits.
