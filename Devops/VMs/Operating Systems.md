### **Operating Systems: Debian vs. Ubuntu vs. Others**

#### **Debian**:

- **Pros**:
    - Extremely stable and reliable.
    - Minimal by default, which means fewer resources are wasted.
    - Excellent for long-term production use due to its slower release cycle.
- **Cons**:
    - Older software versions by default (can use backports or manually build newer packages).
- **Best For**: A stable, no-frills environment that prioritizes reliability over the latest features.

#### **Ubuntu**:

- **Pros**:
    - More user-friendly with better community support for newer tools and software.
    - Offers LTS (Long-Term Support) versions with 5 years of updates.
    - Frequently the default for many guides, scripts, and tools.
- **Cons**:
    - Slightly more resource-heavy than Debian due to extra bundled tools.
- **Best For**: Ease of use and access to the latest features without sacrificing too much stability.

#### **Other Options**:

- **Alpine Linux**:
    - Lightweight and highly optimized, great for container-based environments.
    - Not ideal for beginners or those unfamiliar with its unique configuration.
- **CentOS Stream/Rocky Linux**:
    - Great for enterprise-grade systems but can feel overkill for personal projects.
    - Slower adoption of cutting-edge tools compared to Ubuntu.
- **Fedora Server**:
    - Bleeding edge and optimized for developers.
    - Shorter lifecycle than Ubuntu/Debian.

#### **Recommendation**:

- **Choose Ubuntu LTS** if you want ease of use with access to newer features and strong community support.
- **Choose Debian** if stability and minimalism are top priorities.

### **Migrating from Azure**

To consolidate costs, youâ€™ll need:

1. **Dockerize your Azure web app**:
    - Export the app into a container.
    - Deploy it alongside other services on your new VM.
2. **Configure SSL Certificates**:
    - Use Let's Encrypt with NGINX for free, automated SSL.
    - Secure your domains and subdomains with ease.
3. **Monitor and Benchmark**:
    - Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana) to track resource usage.
    - Ensure the $50/month plan meets your needs before fully migrating off Azure.
