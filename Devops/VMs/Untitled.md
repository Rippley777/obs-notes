### **What You’ve Already Done**

Here’s why your actions are solid:

1. **Changing the Root User and Disabling Root Login**:
    
    - This eliminates direct root access, reducing the attack surface significantly.
2. **Using a Firewall**:
    
    - Allowing only specific ports (like your custom SSH port) keeps most attackers at bay.
3. **Restricting Login to a Single Username**:
    
    - Only allowing one account means fewer potential targets.
4. **Strong Passwords + SSH Key Authentication Only**:
    
    - Disabling password-based authentication (`PasswordAuthentication no`) is critical and eliminates brute-force password attacks.
5. **Changing the SSH Port**:
    
    - While this doesn’t add security by itself, it reduces noise from bots scanning default ports like `22`.
6. **Disabling PAM and ChallengeResponseAuthentication**:
    
    - These prevent alternative authentication methods that could bypass your SSH key-based security.

### **Additional Steps for Ultimate Peace of Mind**

Here are a few advanced measures to consider if you want to take it further:

#### **1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for SSH**

- Adds an extra layer of security beyond SSH keys.
    
- Install `libpam-google-authenticator`:
    `sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator google-authenticator`
    
- Follow the prompts to set up TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Passwords) using an app like Google Authenticator or Authy.
    
- Enable it in `/etc/pam.d/sshd`:

    `auth required pam_google_authenticator.so`
    
- Restart SSH:

    `sudo systemctl restart ssh`
    

---

#### **2. Use Fail2Ban**

- Dynamically bans IPs that fail login attempts too many times.
- Install Fail2Ban:

    `sudo apt install fail2ban`
    
- Configure `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` to protect SSH:

    `[sshd] enabled = true port = <your-custom-ssh-port> maxretry = 5 bantime = 1h`
    
- Start and enable the service:
  
    `sudo systemctl start fail2ban sudo systemctl enable fail2ban`
    

---

#### **3. Set Up SSH IP Whitelisting**

- If you only connect from a specific IP address or range, configure your firewall to allow only those IPs:

    `sudo ufw allow from <your-ip> to any port <your-ssh-port>`
    
- Block all other SSH traffic.

---

#### **4. Use a Bastion Host**

- For an ultra-secure setup, you could deploy a bastion host that acts as a secure gateway for accessing your main server. You would SSH into the bastion host first and then connect to your actual server.

---

#### **5. Regularly Monitor Logs**

- Keep an eye on `/var/log/auth.log` to check for suspicious login attempts:

    `sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log`
    

---

#### **6. Regularly Audit Open Ports**

- Double-check open ports to ensure no unintended services are exposed:

    `sudo netstat -tulnp`
    

---

#### **7. Use Intrusion Detection**

- Install tools like `rkhunter` or `chkrootkit` to scan for rootkits or suspicious changes:

    `sudo apt install rkhunter chkrootkit sudo rkhunter --check sudo chkrootkit`
    

---

#### **8. Harden Kernel Parameters**

- Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` to apply extra protections:

    `net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1 net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1 net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1 net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1 net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0 net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0`
    
- Apply the changes:

    `sudo sysctl -p`
    

---

#### **9. Regular Backups**

- Always have a backup strategy. Even if your server is compromised, you can rebuild it quickly from backups:
  
    `sudo tar -czf backup.tar.gz /etc /home`
    

---

#### **10. Use a Monitoring Service**

- Services like Nagios, Zabbix, or Prometheus can alert you to unusual activity (e.g., spikes in CPU or network traffic).
