## Creating a Link with a Different Name

`[Link Text](URL)`
- Link Text: The name you want to display.
- URL: The target of the link (can be a website or another note).

#### Example
`[Obsidian Homepage](https://obsidian.md)`

This will display the text "Obsidian Homepage" as a clickable link that directs to `https://obsidian.md`.

## Linking to Notes in Obsidion

`[Custom Name](Note Name)`

`[Daily Notes](Daily Log)`

This will display "Daily Notes" as the link, which, when clicked, opens the note titled "Daily Log."

### For linking to specific headers or blocks in a note, append the anchor:

`[Section](Note Name#Header Name)`

#### Example
`[Read This Section](My Note#Important Info)`
