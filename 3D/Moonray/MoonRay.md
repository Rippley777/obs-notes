MoonRay is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade 3D renderer developed by **DreamWorks Animation**. Initially used internally for DreamWorks' animated films, it was released to the open-source community in **2023**. It is designed for advanced rendering workflows, delivering high-quality, physically based rendering (PBR) with modern and scalable architecture.

## Key Features

### 1. **Physically Based Rendering**

- MoonRay uses a **physically-based shading** model to simulate realistic light and material interactions.
- It supports advanced features like global illumination, subsurface scattering, and complex material layering.

### 2. **Scalability**

- Built for scalability, MoonRay efficiently uses **multi-core CPUs** and **high-performance networks**.
- It leverages **Embree**, Intel's high-performance ray-tracing library, to accelerate rendering.

### 3. **Path Tracing**

- Supports **path tracing** for realistic lighting and shading.
- Offers a **biased and unbiased rendering mode** to balance quality and speed.

### 4. **Distributed Rendering**

- MoonRay supports distributed rendering, allowing tasks to be split across multiple machines for faster production.

### 5. **Open Standards**

- Compatible with **Universal Scene Description (USD)** and **MaterialX**, enabling integration into diverse pipelines.
- Supports open-source ecosystems, making it versatile for both VFX studios and individual creators.

### 6. **Customizable and Extensible**

- Developers can extend MoonRay's capabilities by adding custom shaders, tools, or optimizations.

## Benefits of MoonRay

- **Production Proven**: Used in blockbuster movies, MoonRay is reliable for high-end production.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for modification and integration, enabling developers to innovate or adapt it to their needs.
- **High Quality**: Delivers photorealistic results with accurate light simulation.
- **Community Support**: Backed by an open-source community and DreamWorks, providing robust support and continuous improvements.

## Use Cases

- **Film Production**: Ideal for feature films requiring complex scenes and photorealistic rendering.
- **VFX**: Supports workflows for creating visual effects in movies, TV shows, and advertisements.
- **Independent Artists**: Open availability makes it accessible for individual creators and small teams.
