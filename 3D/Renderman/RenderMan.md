RenderMan is a high-performance, photorealistic 3D rendering software developed by **Pixar Animation Studios**. Initially created for Pixar's internal use in the late 1980s, it has become an industry standard for rendering visual effects and animations, used in countless blockbuster films. Known for its flexibility, efficiency, and cinematic quality, RenderMan remains one of the most advanced rendering solutions available today.

## Key Features

### 1. **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**

- RenderMan incorporates a **physically-based shading** model for realistic lighting and material behavior.
- Features robust support for global illumination, subsurface scattering, and volumetric effects.

### 2. **Reyes and RIS Rendering**

- Supports two rendering engines:
    - **Reyes**: Focused on scanline rendering for speed and efficiency.
    - **RIS (RenderMan Integrator System)**: A path-tracing system for physically accurate, high-quality images.

### 3. **Layered Materials**

- RenderMan's **PxrSurface** shader allows complex material layering for detailed surfaces.
- Supports custom shading with programmable shader development.

### 4. **XPU Technology**

- Combines **CPU and GPU rendering** in a single workflow for increased flexibility and performance.
- Dynamically allocates tasks between CPUs and GPUs depending on scene requirements.

### 5. **Advanced Lighting Tools**
