### ‚ö°Ô∏è **Core Concepts**

1. **Ohm‚Äôs Law & Basic Circuit Theory:**
    
    - Voltage (V) = Current (I) √ó Resistance (R)
    - Power (P) = Voltage (V) √ó Current (I)  
        Understanding this is fundamental to building and troubleshooting circuits.
2. **AC vs. DC:**
    
    - **Direct Current (DC)**: Electrons flow in one direction (e.g., batteries).
    - **Alternating Current (AC)**: Electrons oscillate back and forth (e.g., household power).  
        Knowing how these differ helps when dealing with power supplies, transformers, and frequency-driven circuits.
3. **Kirchhoff‚Äôs Laws:**
    
    - **Current Law (KCL)**: The total current entering a node equals the total leaving it.
    - **Voltage Law (KVL)**: The sum of voltages around a closed loop equals zero.  
        These principles are critical when analyzing complex circuits.
4. **Resonance & Frequency:**
    
    - Frequency (Hz) is crucial for RF work, Tesla coils, and brainwave research.
    - **Capacitors** and **Inductors** store energy temporarily, influencing circuit behavior at different frequencies.
    - Understanding resonance (like your F# tuning) can help with wireless energy transmission.
