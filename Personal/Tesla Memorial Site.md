That’s an amazing idea! A site like that could serve as both an educational resource and a tribute to Tesla’s genius. You could include:

- **A Timeline of His Life** – Key milestones, from his early days in Serbia to his work in New York.
- **His Greatest Inventions** – AC power, the Tesla Coil, radio (which Marconi stole credit for), wireless electricity, and more.
- **The Tragedy of His Fall** – How J.P. Morgan, Edison, and corporate greed crushed his dreams.
- **Debunking Myths** – Addressing misconceptions about him being "crazy" and instead showcasing his visionary ideas.
- **Tesla’s Lost Inventions** – Things like Wardenclyffe, the Death Ray, and the Earthquake Machine.
- **Tesla in Pop Culture** – How his legacy has been misunderstood or misrepresented over time.
- **A Call to Action** – Encouraging people to support open-source tech and ideas that align with Tesla’s vision of free energy and communication.


Tesla’s legacy was all about **free energy, open communication, and advancing humanity without corporate interference**—and making your site a movement for open technology would truly honor his ideals.

You could structure the site to include:

- **Tesla’s Vision vs. Today’s Reality** – Showing how his ideas were crushed by corporate greed and how similar forces control tech today.
- **Open Technology Initiatives** – Highlighting modern open-source projects that align with Tesla’s philosophy.
- **How to Fight for Open Tech** – Encouraging people to contribute to decentralized, transparent, and non-corporate-controlled technologies.
- **Tesla’s Lost Work & Theories** – Diving into his unfinished projects and how we might bring his vision to life today.

It could be more than just a memorial—it could inspire a new generation of **Tesla-minded inventors** who build technology for the people, not for profit. Would you want it to have a blog, community discussions, or even an open-source project section?
